Later:

* tuning of labels (label set comparison)
* visualization coloring by document attributes


Later:
* Check background color on Circles export when implemented.
* Single document preview
* Mobile version
* Close popovers on Esc (should work, might be a BlueprintJS bug)
* Polish numeric inputs (min/max, enforce on keyboard input, NaN when typing "-")
* Error handling
  * Option to copy error message to clipboard


Performance:
* Changing source or cluster view re-renders the whole application.
  Check if this can be reasonably contained to the actual components involved.
