After that you hit a wall with scancode mapping.\n\nInstead, install uawks.   Its a little program that uses AutoHotKey scripts to map your Mac keyboard keys to the PC equivalents.

      "Currently I use KeePass on my PC, an free open-source software on Windows to manage passwords. The iPhone version of KeePass is not available yet, but it is in development.\n\nAn existing commercial product for the iPhone is Iliumsoft's eWallet. It has some nice features like synchronization to a desktop PC version of the software. Besides usernames and passwords, you can also use it for storing other sensitive information.\n",
      "Wanting to upgrade my current three-password method (basic, secure, and super-secure), I spent this evening researching this very topic. I wanted something that worked well with Firefox on my PC and Safari on my iPhone. I ended up deciding that there wasn't a sufficiently good solution. Here are the candidates are here's why I don't like 'em:\n\nKeePass: Highly-regarded open source password manager, works with Firefox. Doesn't yet have iPhone support. Supposedly will have iPhone app Real Soon Now.\n\neWallet: Seems good, but costs money on the iPhone and PC, plus no Firefox support.\n\nSplashID: Seems good, but costs money on the iPhone and PC, plus no Firefox support.\n\n1Password: Seems perfect, has a clever bookmarklet solution for auto-filling on the iPhone, but is Mac-only (and costs money).\n\nLastPass: Seems great, almost perfect, but stores your passwords on their server. Also seems to have cool bookmarklet feature, but this only works on the Mac. Came closest to persuading me.\n",
      "This is an old thread, but in looking for a password manager for iPhone and PC it came up at the top of the list. And for us as users we need to share real experiences. As of this writing my last hope will be eWallet, but I've yet to try it. I'd prefer to trust my data to an established company that's clicks AND mortar. But what I do know is this...\n\nI've long experience with RoboForm and RoboForm2Go. Short of a heavy-duty, mightily-encrypted thing like IronKey, RoboForm works like a champ and does what it's supposed to do. Tech support is passable but sometimes you have to insist they properly answer your questions. RoboForm encrypts sensitive data behind good passwords and automates log-ins (behind as many or as few master passwords as you like). It's one flaw is that the titles of its Passcards and SafeNotes can be read, deleted and/or copied while RoboForm is logged-out. But in order to use them you'd have to un-encrypt and un-lock them and that's not likely to happen without your permission. So, for me, for accounts which have little money in them, the trade-offs are quite acceptable.\n\nBUT, now I've got a new iPhone and need an app which performs with RoboForm's ease and also syncs to my PC desktop. SplashID isn't the one; I've tried it and found both the application and tech support lacking. When I tried to create automatic log-ins for two test accounts in SplashID, BOTH log-ins wouldn't launch automatically. SplashData's tech support explained that, \"was a problem with the Web page,\" whereas RoboForm simply launches and logs-in easily and nearly effortlessly. SplashIDs tech support also had to be nudged, heavily, to explain what was or wasn't happening with their software. My experience of SplashID was it's Mediocreware.\n\nSo, I'm still looking. BUT, I won't be up-loading my sensitive log-in credentials to RoboForm Online's servers so I can access them from my iPhone. That's bloody nuts - anyone who'd ask you to do that has a heavily-inflated false sense of security. The first issue is that you'd have to trust RoboForm with your data. No, I don't on their server. Think of all the recent and legendary hacks into financial systems like banks. Look at sites like SecurityMetrics.com for a glimpse of news about this. And RoboForm's security couldn't be as strong as a bank's. If I was a hacker, I'd say RoboForm's Online servers would be an excellent target for some big-money thefts.\n",

      "KeePass should be a safe choice. It is an open source app with multiplatform ports.\nPassword file import support is excellent. Available export formats are limited, but as long as the application works in every platform you need, this shouldn't be a problem. \n\nNevertheless, KeePass iPhone support has been very limited.\nI have used MyKeePass since it was released early in 2010. Usability is not that great, because you have to type your master password every time you open the password file. Even with iPhone OS4 multitasking, this practically means EVERY time you'll need a password.\nMyKeePass was out of the App Store for a while, but iPhone OS4 compatible version has been released now. \nThere is also iKeePass, but it is only available in the U.S. App Store.\n\nI think that multiplatform support and migration options are the most important features in a password manager. It is extremely painful to manually migrate lots of entries. Before, I used to have a Nokia Symbian phone with a synchronizable password manager (Handy Safe 5.0).\nIt actually worked better than KeePass + iPhone, had a decent two-way sync through USB for example. \nBut, Handy Safe 5.0 didn't have any export formats and no other password manager imported Handy Safe files.\n(KeePass added Handy Safe 5.12 file support later, though.)\n"

My default input language is set to Spanish, but sometimes Windows changes this setting automatically when you switch applications (and thus you get a different keyboard layout). \n\nWhy is that?\n\n(I've become a huge fan of ALT + LEFT SHIFT, which lets you cycle through the available languages.)\n",

I'm Danish, working with English content, on Austrian (German) Windows computers, and I've seen this too often to count.\n\nThe best solution I can offer is to choose just one input language and go with that one only. \n\nFor me, it means always using a Danish layout because then I can type the German special characters (the DK layout has an ¨ umlaut key) as well as the Danish special characters (which a German layout can't), plus all of the English of course. \n\nThe downside may be a suboptimal typing speed in other languages, but at least the keyboard matches Windows' input language all the time.

      "Using the built-in Export to PDF option in OpenOffice.org has one VERY major advantage over anything that simulates a printer: it creates clickable table of contents, cross-references, indexes and explicit internet links. Of course, most PDF viewers will recognise some URLs and email addresses. But when linking some text to some URL, most PDF printers do not make that into a clickable link. That's simply because the print processor does not \"tell\" the PDF printer about this.\n\nAs a side note: on a Mac, PDF is very much integrated. Still, when using OpenOffice.org on a Mac, one should also explicitly use Export to PDF -- using the Save to PDF option from a Mac's print dialog does not create clickable links. However, some other Mac programs do in fact somehow send such information to the Mac's print processor, through the print dialog. For example, when saving to PDF using the print dialog in Pages, Safari or OmniWeb (the latter being non-Apple software), all links are in fact clickable. (On a Mac, when one does NOT want clickable links when saving a web site as PDF, one should in fact use Firefox instead.)\n\nBy the way: getting a clickable table of contents is a very good reason to learn how to use styles and headers. One should never have to create a table of contents manually!\n",

Is it coded completely in JavaScript?\n\nDoes anyone else have the same perception? \n\nEDIT\n\nI think a clarification is needed. \n\nI was referring to the performance/ behavior of course, but also to the GUI.\n\nIt is quite different on those platforms.  \n\nLinux:\n\n\n\nWindows:\n\n\n\n I don't have a Vista/7 screenshot at hand, that's why I use XP\n\nMac\n\n\n",
    "acceptedAnswer" : "Apparently, it's because Linux users want it that way:\n\n\n  The reason Linux isn’t shown above is that all of the feedback we’ve received so far indicates that Linux users would be happier with a theme that uses native GTK icons in the navigation toolbar, which rules out this type of customized visual treatment.\n\n",

      "Firefox doesn't suck on Linux.  It might eat up some resources, indirectly, if you don't use Gnome or GTK and have limited hardware.  Or perhaps you've lucked out with a bad build/hardware combination.  But from my limited experiences, I don't see a problem.\n\nEdit: Looking at your updated question, I'll say this much: that's different HTML.  I get the same image (balloons) every time, so it's not just random.  For some reason they chose to have a different background image and layout for each platform; maybe the fonts are slightly different but that's a non-issue.\n\nOr if you're talking about the GUI itself, well, I'm glad it changes per platform.  UI integration is always a good thing.\n",
      "It's a single core code base but there are different pieces of code for platform specific features (UI, for instance). No it's not completely Javascript. There's plenty of C++ in it.\n",
      "Each version uses a different front end. For example on Mac OS X firefox uses a Cocoa UI - which means it can integrate with other Cocoa applications and the system more easily than if it were written with another API.\n\nDepending on what GUI APIs are used on Windows on Linux (I don't know about windows, but I assume Linux is GTK+) you will see different levels and experiences of integration.\n",
      "I wouldn't say it rocks on OS X... it's slow, the UI doesn't match the rest of the OS, and so on... I'm using Safari and it works well. I use FF when things don't work (not very often) or when using a download manager to speed up large HTTP downloads.\n"

Opera is a solid choice, though its default skin is worse than Firefox.

It will setup Grub (or something compatible) to prompt you on start up which OS you want to boot.\n\n(If you don't already have windows installed it's generally considered best practise to install windows first as sometimes it can overwrite your Linux boot loader with it's own.

(K)Ubuntu is the most popular and has the largest community, but the others are good choices, too.\n\nYou'll find there are several ways to install Ubuntu.  The installation guide offers a decent overview, but you could also try Wubi (the Windows Ubuntu installer).\n\nYou might find some kinks while trying to install one of the distros, so pick a few to try.  I'd recommend Ubuntu/Kubuntu, Fedora Core, or OpenSuSE, in that order.  Ubuntu and Fedora work best with Gnome, a fairly simple desktop environment.  Kubuntu and OpenSuSE work best with KDE, which is a bit flashier.  They also have different selections of applications that come bundled, although you can install any of them.\n\nDual-booting is extremely common, so it's addressed by nearly every tutorial you'll find.  However, if you can afford it, consider buying another hard drive instead; unconventional advice, but you won't go wrong with it.\n"

This is a strategy you should think about, regardless of the platform / backup software you use or even the media you use. Tape loaders may change a bit your tape rotation strategy as well. Another thing to consider is the off-site storage of your backups. Here, it also depends on how critical your data is. If your office has a disaster, can you continue operations somewhere else ? Finally, the off-site storage of tapes can be done different ways. For example, some will take the latest backup off-site immediately, others will the previous one off-site, but will keep the latest on-site, for easier recovery. \n\nMy point here is that the software/hardware is only one piece of establishing a backup strategy.

    "question" : "I've recently been trying to 'install' stuff a lot less on my Windows machine (I hate installers - I need to know where programs put stuff...), choosing to use portable or standalone versions of applications instead.\n\nI put them all in a 'Programs' dir on a drive separate from my Windows partition, so whenever I reinstall, I have all my applications available with minimal effort and on the plus side, I get a nice clean setup.\n\nApplications like Office and Creative Suite still require me to go through a horribly long installation process where a thousand random libraries and tools are thrown across my system.\n\nWhy do Windows apps still need installing? Why can't we just drag Photoshop to a folder à la OSX and just have it work? Does anyone else focus on portable apps, or am I just being OCD about the whole thing?\n",
    "acceptedAnswer" : "Installers are a result of years of evolution and a little bit of (simplified) history helps understand why they do what they do..\n\nThe windows 3.1 model suggested config.ini style configuration files per application with supporting shared libaries going into system folders to prevent duplication and wasted disk space.\n\nWindows 95 introduced the registry allowing a central store for application configuration replacing many configuration files.  More importantly, windows configuration was stored in the same place.\n\nThe registry became bloated due to applications not cleaning up after themselves.  DLL hell happened as a result of multiple versions of the same shared libraries overwriting each other.\n\n.NET introduced the concept of app.config (almost ini files mark 2, this time with a little more structure saving developers wasting time writing manual parsers). The GAC was introduced to version shared assemblies in an attempt to prevent DLL Hell.\n\nIn Windows XP and moreso in Vista, Microsoft attempted to define the userspace as a place to store user data and configuration files in a single standard location to allow for roamning profiles and easy migration (just copy your profile) with the applications installed in Program Files.\n\nSo I guess, the reason is that \"applications in windows are designed to live in one place, their shared dependencies in another, and the user specific data in another\", which pretty much works against the concept of xcopying a single location.\n\n.. and that's before you have to configure user accounts, and setup and ensure security permissions, and download updates, and install windows services...\n\nxcopy is the \"simple case\" and certainly isn't a best fit for everything.\n",

      "XCOPY deployment was announced by Microsoft as the way of the future a couple years ago. Still nothing :)\n\nMeantime, you might be interested in PortableApps.com platform.\n",
      "Great question, I asked a related question on Stack Overflow a while ago.\n\nThe answer often seems to be \"because that's how we've done it in the past\".  Sorry but that doesn't wash with me.\n\nA few others have said the main reason is due to the registry.  If you are talking about a device driver or some other COM component etc, then yes this may be necessary, but not for GUI applications such as Word processors or spreadsheets.\n\nIt's quite possible to write an application that either checks on start-up for required registry settings, and prompts the user for them / uses defaults.  Or, as many protable apps currently do, jst let the user know that OS integration is currently limited because you are running in portable mode.\n\nInstallers often also have a lot of \"knowledge\" about how the application works.  Then when the application changes, you often have to update the installer too.  This is a classic cause of bugs/problems I've seen in my time programming.\n\nIt's the one size fit's all approach.\n",
      "Simple and blunt answer: it's simply a question of who has control. Most software nowadays is designed by corporate giants for the corporate or institutional environment where users are told what to do instead of telling their computers what to do for them. \n\nYour question is extremely important because it raises a fundamental question about individual rights and freedoms that are being eroded more and more, not by tyrants like in societies of old, but by corporate greed and the need of the few to control the many.\n\nAs a matter of fact, we seem to have forgotten that the exact same people who used to decry the tyranny of giants such as IBM have become the IBMs of this day and age... Just look closely at the business practices of Microsoft, Apple and Adobe to name a few and tell me with a straight face that with their restrictive licenses are more benign than IBM's business practices were, the same IBM who, by their openness, actually led the path to the personal computing revolution...\n\nI have been using many self contained, portable apps over the years and without exception they have proven to be the most effective, the fastest and the smallest in terms of footprint and resources and last but not least, not only are they superior to their bloatware counterparts, but most of the time, they are free as well.\n\nIt's high time for a second personal computer revolution. Enhancing portability by reducing bloat and clarifying where settings are stored, in one distinct folder on a distinct physical location on a tangible, physical medium, is one step in the right direction.\n",
      "Mostly because of the windows registry - even though your programs are in a certain directory, settings are often stored in the registry.\n\nIt can also be because the program puts files in other directories on your computer other than the install directory (system32 for example)\n"
    ],
    "otherAnswers" : [
      "A combination of the registry and per user storage.  The registry is a critical piece, especially if your application is COM based (which requires registering, which happens in the registry).  Per user storage (of configuration etc) is also an important component.  The only good way to do this is to store it in some specially designed directories (see Isolated Storage).\n",
      "One big advantage to installers over the Xcopy/portable installation type is self-repair.\n\nAn app that uses the Windows Installer system properly will have all sorts of info about it saved in the Windows Installer database on your machine, as well as quite often a cache of important parts of the setup files.\n\nIf the app breaks for some reason (something else deletes/replaces a file, registry gets corrupted, disk problems, user deletes shortcut etc) then if its an \"advertised shortcut\" the Installer actually checks key files and keys every time it starts up and replaces if they're not present, or you can go into Add/Remove Programs and click Repair on the app.\n",
      "I think it's partly to do with the large amounts of cruft windows apps need. For example, Registry keys, User data (/Users//AppData). Perhaps OSX just handles this better/differently.\n\nThen again it's not impossible to create apps that you can just extract from an archive - I'm always happy when this is the case.\n",
      "The .Net Framework is the platform to enable this type of functionality, and mostly installers are just used because this is what normal users are used to. The same way Mac users are used to copying files into the Applications folder.\n\nMajority of installers simply expand files into the Program Files folder and creates a shortcut. It's more a case of what users know, and often it is just to simpler to keep the process the same even if the application is portable.\n",
      "Some programs require that the install location be in the registry, others may have their locations hard-coded into the program (this was the case for perl.exe).\n\nBasically the main reason is programmers who took the easy way out, and hard-coded something into the programs, either registry keys, or actual hard-coded paths.\n",
      "Many Windows applications must make use of system environments or services, such as SQL Server, IIS, WMI, security domains, Active Directory, and many others. A typical user may have no idea how to configure these, or may not even have access to them.\n\nApplications like Microsoft Office are not single files; they contains dozens of files, executables, utilities, services, templates, plug-ins, drivers, and so on. When you install an application you can't just overwrite everything the new app uses, it has to fit in with what's already there. Windows installers do more than just copy files, they can query the system environment, run scripts and install services, and set up the machine as if they were an administrator.\n\ndbkk101 asks why Windows apps \"can't all just get along\". They can, that is what installers are for.\n",
      "Granted with some programs, installation is silly but theres a lot more than just \"dragging a file into programs directory\".\n\nAt the very least, a decent installer with decompress the installation file and set up the appropriate shortcuts and make it easy to remove the program when no longer wanted. I thnk the decompression and copy is probably what takes the longest.\n\nThen there are shared files -- this is especially true in the Linux world though not so much in Windows IMO. \n\nMost importantly, some programs need to be configured for the machine and some (I presume at least) attempt to optimize based on the machine or at least thats what adobe's dialog leads me to believe. \n\nAlso, I've never seen a reason to install on a separate partition. You tend to lose all your registry values and config settings. Plus, i actually prefer that loss cause it reduces the Windows bloat.\n"

    "question" : "I keep hearing that this is a huge no-no. Why is this? I run Ubuntu mostly so it doesn't affect me, but I was just wondering.\n",
    "acceptedAnswer" : "Solid state drives are based on flash memory, which age very differently than standard spinning platter-based hard drives.  Each sector has a limited number of write cycles, so the drives include wear-leveling features that allows the drive to last longer by essentially fragmenting the drive on purpose.\n\nThe read times are not greatly improved by defragmenting as they are in standard drives, so there is no real gain in defragmentation, but by doing so, you are increasing the number of writes to the drive, thereby decreasing the drive life.\n",
    "topAnswers" : [
      "Defragmenting puts your sectors near each other which is helpful for a disk that spins around. However, this is useless on an SSD which has constant access time for any sector. Defragmenting just causes extra writes on a disk (SSDs have a limited number of writes due to their design)\n",
      "Note that there shouldn't be any technical reason for not \"being able to defragment a solid state disk\", in the sense that you could start a defragmenter program and run it against the disk.\n\nBut doing so doesn't have the effect it does on non-solid state disks, as moving the clusters together won't actually speed up the disk.\n\nOn the other hand, what you will do is perform lots of unnecessary writes on the disk, and this will shorten, albeit slightly, the life-span of the disk.\n\nAdditionally, many solid-state disks does optimizations to lessen this problem by reducing repeated writes to the same area, and this is transparent to the outside system, in which case the clusters might not be moved together at all but instead spread out over the disk. This technique is typically \"wear leveling\".\n\nIf a defragmenter program refuses to defragment a solid state disk (or even just list it as a disk you can select), I'd wager that it's basically a software refusal to do so, just to avoid the problems outlined above.\n\nNote that I don't know enough about the underlying protocols used to defragment a disk, so there might very well be a hard block from a solid state disk to accept defragment commands, if there are such things. The reasons for this, however, are the ones described here.\n",
      "Defragging will lower the live expectancy of your drive by performing unnecessary passes over a drive with a limited life-span.\n",
      "It depends on what is on the drive. You will not get any performance increase by defragging an SSD, but it will have an impact on data-recovery.\n\nOn the one hand, flash-memory has a limited number of write cycles, so doing a lot of writing will eventually wear it out. Flash drives, memory cards, and SSDs use tricks like wear-leveling and TRIM to extend the life of the media, but defragmentation tends to cause a large number of writes, which will cause it wear out all the faster.\n\nOn the other hand, fragmented files are infinitely harder to recover when accidentally deleted, hit by a virus, etc. so keeping your files in a contiguous state (e.g., by defragmenting) will greatly increase the chances of recovery.\n\nTherefore, like I said at the start, it depends on what is stored on the drive, how important the files are, how likely you are to need to perform data-recovery, and how frequently the files are changed (frequent deletions and copies will lead to fragmentation faster as well as eat up more write cycles).\n"

    "otherAnswers" : [
      "Actually, you can. Defragmentation is a filesystem-level thing, it doesn't matter what is on the lower, block level.\n\nBut in the case of the SSD there is no disk head whose movements should be minimized. Thus, it won't be faster, not even a little bit.\n\nSome OSes and tools forbid this only, because the decisions of their developer companies like to mix the meaning of \"you don't need\" and \"you can't\". But these are different things.\n\nProbably there are multiple hacks which could avoid this ban (regedit, or exporting the drive as iscsi and re-importing to the same machine, etc). In this case, you will find  a very fragmented drive, whose defrag will be very long. It is because the OS doesn't care about fragmentation on their case. And, as other answers also mention, this defrag won't make your system faster, but it will reduce its life.\n",
      "According to Condusiv Technologies:\n\nSSDs start out really fast and then quickly start to lose their speed and over time become subject to corruption. SSDs require that old data be erased before new data is written over it, rather than just writing over the old information like with hard drives. This doubles the wear and tear and can cause major issues.\n\nThe principle issue is write speed degradation due to free space fragmentation. Small free spaces scattered across the SSD cause the file system to write a file in fragmented pieces to those small available free spaces. By doing so, it degrades write performance by as much as 80% to the solid state drive.\n\nSSDs can only write so many times to the drive as they have a finite number of writes that they can perform. Due to the doubling effect of needing to read and erase before it can write again, SSDs undergo twice as much use.\n\nAs the SSD approaches its limit, more fragmentation and write errors occur, causing SSD slows. Write performance decreases proportionately as free space fragmentation increases. All SSDs will suffer from this problem at one point or another unless HyperFast is used to optimize the solid state drive.\n\nThey therefore recommend using their product called Diskeeper.Accoding to the company:\n\nDiskeeper with HyperFast keeps your system running as fast as when you purchased it, by optimizing the free space on your SSD. The HyperFast feature, included with Diskeeper 12 specifically solves these issues by intelligently eliminating performance–degrading free space fragmentation which can promote random rather than the more efficient sequential writes to occur. This technology along with the IntelliWrite Technology promotes the more efficient and beneficial sequential writes to occur rather than random writes.\n\nMore info about their product is available:\n\nhttp://www.condusiv.com/products/diskeeper/\n",
      "It is not bad all the time. Manually running a full defragmentation is something you should not do, but if you have volume snapshots are enabled, windows 8/10 will defrag the SSD once per month:\n\n\n  This is by design and necessary due to slow volsnap copy on write\n  performance on fragmented SSD volumes. It’s also somewhat of a\n  misconception that fragmentation is not a problem on SSDs. If an SSD\n  gets too fragmented you can hit maximum file fragmentation (when the\n  metadata can’t represent any more file fragments) which will result in\n  errors when you try to write/extend a file. Furthermore, more file\n  fragments means more metadata to process while reading/writing a file,\n  which can lead to slower performance.\n  \n  Conclusion\n  \n  No, Windows is not foolishly or blindly running a defrag on your SSD\n  every night, and no, Windows defrag isn't shortening the life of your\n  SSD unnecessarily. Modern SSDs don't work the same way that we are\n  used to with traditional hard drives.\n  \n  Yes, your SSD's file system sometimes needs a kind of defragmentation\n  and that's handled by Windows, monthly by default, when appropriate.\n  The intent is to maximize performance and a long life. If you disable\n  defragmentation completely, you are taking a risk that your filesystem\n  metadata could reach maximum fragmentation and get you potentially in\n  trouble.\n\n"

      "To answer your question: There are no risks to disabling UAC, provided you run as a standard user.\n\n\n\nYou should always run as a standard user on Windows. \n\nOn Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7, you can create an account that is a standard user. The downside of this is that if you want to perform anything that requires administrative access to the computer, e.g.:\n\n\nchanging date/time\ninstalling software into program files\nediting local machine registry settings\n\n\nyou will have to fast-user switch to an administrator account in order to perform the operation, then switch back.\n\nNobody wants to actually run as a standard user all the time, so they run as an administrator full time. The risks of running as an administrator is that you can accidentally damage your Windows installation. Running malware, or a security breach, can take complete control of your computer.\n\nUAC is the comprimise, where you are stripped of your admin privelages, unless something comes along that requires admin access. UAC temporarily grants you admin privelages, until that operation is complete.\n\n\nRunning with UAC enabled is the same as running as a standard user.\nRunning with UAC disabled is the same as running as an administrator.\nRunning as an administrator is a risk.\n\n\n\n\nNote: Even with UAC disabled, ie and Chrome will still use protected mode.\n\nUAC is a technology where you are stripped of your admin privelages, so you can't do damage. Internet Explorer and Google Chrome both take advantage of a similar feature available since Vista. They run in \"protected mode\"; they run with less privelages than even standard user.\n\nEven if you disable UAC, and run as an administrator full-time, your browser will still run lower than you, to protect you from you.\n\nNote: Firefox does not support protected mode, and will run with the same privelages as you are. i.e.:\n\n\nAdministrator, UAC enabled: runs as standard user\nAdministrator, UAC disabled: runs as administrator\nStandard user, UAC enabled: runs as standard user\nStardard user, UAC disabled: runs as standard user\n\n\n\n\ni don't recommend anyone disable UAC. But if you must, run as a standard user. If you cannot stand runnnig as a standard user, at least use Internet Explorer or Google Chrome. If you use Firefox as an administrator with UAC disabled, and you encounter a security vulnerability, (e.g. you used flash last year), your computer can be completely taken over.\n",

    "question" : "I've got a 22-inch, 1680 x 1050 monitor.  Brand X2gen, model MW22U.  Connected by DVI cable to my NVIDIA GeForce 9600 GT graphics card.\n\nSeveral days ago my monitor stopped working.  It displayed nothing after the boot process.\n\nI loaded Safe Mode which forced it to 1024 x 768, which did display.  I installed updated drivers for my graphics card (NVIDIA GeForce ION Driver 185.85) which forced it to 1024 x 768 when I then returned to Normal Mode.\n\nBut I cannot set it to a resolution higher than 1024 x 768!\n\n\n\nI then tested it with another monitor--a 20-inch, 1680 x 1050 Dell--which was detected successfully and did run at its native resolution.  So, the problem is the monitor, not the computer or video card.\n\nI switched back to the problem 22-inch monitor which was still suck at 1024 x 768.  I noticed that the monitor was \"Generic Non-PnP\".  I think before it was \"Generic PnP\".  I changed the monitor driver to \"Generic PnP\".  That didn't help.\n\nI've installed and reinstalled NVIDIA GeForce ION Driver 185.85, but that doesn't fix it.\n\n\n\nI've tried to add \"Custom Resolutions\" in the NVIDIA Control Panel.  That errors with: \"Custom mode test failed.\"\n\n\n\nHow might I be able to force Windows to use this monitor's native resolution?\n",

      "The most likely reason is that the EDID data of your monitor is corrupted or not transferred correctly. \n\nEDID tells your system which features the monitor has and which resolution it supports.\n\nFirst check if there's anything which could prevent the EDID exchange: Broken cable, damaged connector, VGA-DVI adapter, one-monitor-two-workstations switch, ...\n\nYou could try to completly disable EDID for your monitor, a quick Google search revealed that this frequently resolved similar problems for other users. \n\nIf this can't be done with the driver software, a last resort would be to disable the pins responsible for EDID on your DVI cable. \n\n\n\nTaken from: http://www.overclock.net/ati/47962-way-disable-edid.html\n\nHowever do be careful: do your own research first and best try with a separate DVI cable first.\n",
      "Try choosing another equivalent monitor, such as the Dell 22\" you tested, instead of \"Generic PnP\".  I've had this problem in the past when connecting to a high resolution overhead projector, and selecting a different monitor from the Windows built-ins did the trick.\n",
      "Three suggestions ...\n\n... Under the Display control panel, click on Advanced Settings and go to the Monitor page. Under Monitor settings, check the screen refresh rate - if this is too high, some resolutions may be locked out on the main screen. Given that you have a LCD, this should be set to 60Hz and left there.\n\n... same location as above, but turn off the setting Hide modes that this monitor cannot display.\n\n... Alternatively under the Adapter tab instead, press List All Modes and select the exact mode you want. This dialog bypasses the usual safeties, so you can screw things up, but should let you set exactly the resolution needed.\n\nHopefully one of these will let you go back to DVI and the better display that results.\n",
      "I'm going to answer this even though it's over three years after the original question was asked.\n\nI ran into this problem recently, and I came across what I believe is a pretty ideal solution.

[Note: I didn't understand this step and ended up just ignoring it, but I'm leaving it in just in case it helps someone.]\nOpen Start, type \"devmgmt.msc\", and press Enter.\nSelect the monitor you want to change (in my case, it was \"Generic Non-PNP Monitor\").\nRight click and select Update Driver Software.\nClick \"Browse my computer for driver software\".\nClick \"Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer.\nClick Have Disk...\nBrowse to the INF file in your working folder.\nClick next to override with your new INF.\nRestart your computer and enjoy your new resolution!\n\n"

    "question" : "Some Windows shortcut key combinations are interfering with my WinSplit Revolution shortcuts. \nWhere are these shortcuts defined in XP and how can I change them?\n",
    "acceptedAnswer" : "You can try changing some via HotKeyBind, AutoIt, AutoHotkey and such programs. You cannot change most of the system implemented default ones (like Win+  E for explorer, Win + R ... and such). I had a question regarding this on SO, and this has been one of the Windows annoyances for me for a while now.\n",
    "topAnswers" : [
      "If the conflicts are ones that start programs, then they are defined as shortcuts in .lnk properties - however there are no defaults so you -- or someone -- has to have set them. \n\nYou can go into explorer and do a properties on each .lnk file -- or if you have some programming skills you can do as I did -- see bottom of this answer.\n\nI found this was implemented \"horribly\" in XP -- apparently the start menu \"tree\" of .lnk files is NOT scanned and loaded into a little table.   So if you haven't used a shortcut in a while it will have to look thru and open every .lnk file until it finds the right one. \n\nInstead I prefer Macro Express, and while fee-based, is definitely worthwhile. \n\nI wrote my own \"find all shortcuts\" program, which is in KEDIT and thus not \"portable\" (for it relies on non-free Kedit to run).  But the LOGIC might help someone else do a search: \n\nThe logic is this:  read the 65th and 66th byte of every .lnk file in the documents and settings\\ files.  \n\nThe 65th byte is the \"key\" with a decimal 220 meaning \"\\\"; and the 66th byte is a bit of \"what other keys go with it\":\n\n'00000110' = \"Ctrl+ Alt \"\n'00000101' = \"Shift+Alt \"\n'00000011' = \"Shift+Ctrl\"\n'00000100' = \"Alt       \"\n'00000010' = \"Ctrl      \"\n'00000001' = \"Shift     \"\n\nP.S. I probably could rewrite this in AUTO-IT to be portable if there is a need and no substitute.  \n",

    "question" : "I'm 99% sure, at this point, that the answer is, \"not possible.\" But I figured there are tons of smart people here who might be able to help me out, even if that help is just to validate that it's not possible.\n\nAbout a year ago, I migrated my home computer to Windows Vista, with a clean install. The clean install is where I went wrong -- like an idiot (and I admit this), I did not back up the EFS key in use on a bunch of my financial and other sensitive files. \n\nI copied all those files (as well as my other documents, source control repositories, etc.) to my second hard drive (formatted NTFS, so EFS stuck around) before the migration. Again, the EFS attributes stuck around, and -- because I'm a dork -- I not only didn't back up the EFS keys, but I also didn't remove the encryption from these files. (I would like to state at this point that the lesson has been learned; I don't even use EFS anymore at all.)\n\nI've tried a variety of applications available online, including several paid apps, and none have had any luck. My hunch is that this is due to wiping and rebuilding the OS from scratch, as the SIDs of my user accounts obviously changed, and the EFS keys were simply gone, not part of the OS.\n\nI'd like to get at these files, or at least be able to delete them without reformatting the drive they're on. :) Does anyone have any advice?

    "question" : "Does it stil make much difference, now that we have much faster and larger HDDs? Generally I find if disk performance is getting too slow, it's probably because of too little free space, and the solution is to buy a new HDD.\n",
    "acceptedAnswer" : "It is still relevant, but since the release of Vista, Windows has automatically defragged your hard drive when the computer was sitting idle. If you leave your computer idle for long periods, this is no longer something which must be done manually.\n",
    "topAnswers" : [
      "It's not relevant on SSDs, which are hardly (if at all) affected by defragmentation (no read-heads to be moved around). And even more: SSDs have a much more limited number of times each part of the \"disk\" can be written to (\"write endurance\"; What is the lifespan of an SSD drive?), so especially for cheap SSDs it's best to use the whole disk, rather than keep using the same parts over and over again by running defragmentation tools.\n\nFor those who've partitioned their hard drive: didn't that introduce a huge fragmentation?\n\nAnd though the question is tagged \"windows\", for those who get here given the generic title: it is not relevant for each file system. Like for a Mac (emphasis mine):\n\n\n  You probably won't need to optimize at all if you use Mac OS X. Here's why:\n  \n  \n  Hard disk capacity is generally much greater now than a few years ago. With more free space available, the file system doesn't need to fill up every \"nook and cranny.\" Mac OS Extended formatting (HFS Plus) avoids reusing space from deleted files as much as possible, to avoid prematurely filling small areas of recently-freed space.\n  Mac OS X 10.2 and later includes delayed allocation for Mac OS X Extended-formatted volumes. This allows a number of small allocations to be combined into a single large allocation in one area of the disk.\n  Fragmentation was often caused by continually appending data to existing files, especially with resource forks. With faster hard drives and better caching, as well as the new application packaging format, many applications simply rewrite the entire file each time. Mac OS X 10.3 Panther can also automatically defragment such slow-growing files. This process is sometimes known as \"Hot-File-Adaptive-Clustering.\"\n  Aggressive read-ahead and write-behind caching means that minor fragmentation has less effect on perceived system performance.  \n  \n  \n  [..]  \n  \n  There is also a chance that one of the files placed in the \"hot band\" for rapid reads during system startup might be moved during defragmentation, which would decrease performance.\n\n\nOf course, the latter would not occur when using a Defrag utility that is included with the operating system.\n",
      "Yes.\n\nOn my friend's PC (XP, NTFS, 80GB HD, ~750MB free), the 700MB pagefile was in 11,000 fragments, and the MFT was in 40 fragments. I cleaned up the hard drive, defragmented, and rebooted, and the difference was very noticeable.\n",
      "It matters, but in Vista and Win7, it should be happening automatically as long as your machine has idle time.\n\nLots of good info.\n",
      "The speed brought by defrag is especially visible on slower hdds, like those on laptops.\n"

      "I think it's still relevant.  I have a C2Duo/2Gb/250Gbx2 setup, and even with the mirrored \"small\" drives, defragging seems to help tremendously with startup and program load times.\n",
      "I would say it still makes sense - specially on hard drives that get a lot of file activities. I run MyDefrag at work to keep my hard drive from getting too fragmented, since at work I usually work on several revision depots that can have thousands of file changes in one day - keeping it defragged really helps on open read performance of the bigger art files I work with, but also on the speed of my text searches. \n"

To my surprise, it was quite a noticeable performance gain. One must understand though, that it's a cache kind of performance gain, meaning that you will notice a quite substantial improvement the 2nd, 3rd time you start an application. Nevertheless, I'm most certainly keeping the SD card in my laptop, it's \"hidden\" away and doesn't stick out like an USB stick.\n",

My computer has always been unresponsive due to heavy disk activity for the first five or so minutes after resuming, and ReadyBoost produced a vast improvement in system performance and responsiveness during this time.\n",
      "We just made a detailed comparison on two computers: one with Windows 8.1 and one with Windows 7.\n\nThe improvements we measured when enabling ReadyBoost on a system with low amounts of RAM, are the following:\n\n\nOpening media files like photos, music or video is slightly faster (approximately by 2%).\nThe loading of web pages and the use of Office applications is slightly faster (approximately by 2%).\nYour system's boot timings are improved (up to 7%).\nYour most used applications start faster (by 10 to 15%).\n\n\nReadyBoost had no positive impact when playing games or running applications that are CPU or GPU intensive.\n\nYou can find the detailed testing procedure plus all the results, here: Does ReadyBoost Work? Does It Improve Performance for Slower PCs?.\n",
      "Like so many things relating to performance, it has a lot to do with what you're doing and the other components in your system.\n\nIf you have a low-end PC, which I doubt anyone on a site called \"Super User\" would :-), it's probably beneficial. For those with capable systems with at least 2G memory (and 4-8G is becoming more common), ReadyBoost probably doesn't add enough performance increase to warrant dedication of an entire flash drive and more important USB port. \n\nMemory is cheap, I just doubled my HTPC upgrading to 4G, using the same exact memory I built the system with originally (2x Corsair twinxsomethingfast) for less than half the price I paid a year ago ($35 vs ~$75). I have a 4G memory flash drive that I'd used with ReadyBoost prior, and it \"feels\" faster with the actual memory.

By comparison flash memory has access times of 4 to 6 ms for equivalent random reads and writes.\n\nWhat ReadyBoost was designed to do was place the most often or recently used 2 to 8 GB of data on the flash memory where accessing it would be at least twice as fast as reading it from the hard drive.\n"

Gotta remember it's cache not ram and not storage. I have windows 8.1.\n\nCouple of things to make the best of readyboost.\n\nFormat to exFAT and not NTFS, use the whole device, the more the better. exFAT does less sequential checking therefore faster. You don't need a journaled file system for 1 big file. There's nothing to journal lmao. Oooo 1 file... Performance exFAT wins.\n\nMake sure it's a class 10 SD if you plan on using SD. Class 4 will offer nothing.\n\nMake sure you're using USB 3. SD or otherwise. I chose SD because it's a  laptop and I don't use the SD port. USB 3 USB stick in my desktop.\n\nThe bigger the size the better. I saw the biggest performance when copying files while using applications. Basically it allows me to install and copy things while working on other stuff without hitting a wall. Windows will also page to it if need be like when using the hard drive, it will cache paging parses. \n\nThe longer you use it the better readyboost and superfetch work together to be the best it can be.\n"

      "Well, using tools such as DBAN or the like is considered to be mostly pointless and also very time consuming. Generally, you do NOT need to do anything else but fill the drive with 0x00 (zero bytes / NUL) once and only once these days, in order to securely prevent the recovery of any former data. Doing multiple passes is excessive and mostly useless, let alone filling the drive with random data. The only way you can try to somehow restore anything, after such an operation took place, is with an atomic-force microscope - this is, obviously, an extreme procedure, that will take months for even the smallest JPG file and the error rate (false-positives) is going to be immense (in other words - you won't get anything meaningful out of this). This is even more true for higher capacity models (higher density platters). However, one can only speculate what tech might be in the hands of the NSA, so judge the provided information with that in mind.\n\nSo, one of the ultimate software ways (fast, reliable &amp; secure), is a single run (zero-fill) of dd:\n\n\n  dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=1M\n\n\nor, if you want to measure progress:\n\n\n  pv &lt; /dev/zero > /dev/sdX\n\n\nHowever, there is something called secure erase. This is an established ATA standard. This function is integrated into the drive itself. Not only is it even faster than a run of dd (as it's already hardware based and hardware > software, speed wise), it is also more secure, due to the ability of purging original bad sectors that have been reallocated! There are 2 versions: the vanilla (2001 and onwards) and the enhanced one (post 2004). So, if your drive was manufactured roughly 10 years ago - it already supports this feature.\n\n\n  hdparm --security-set-pass NULL /dev/sdX\n  \n  hdparm --security-erase NULL /dev/sdX\n  hdparm --security-erase-enhanced NULL /dev/sdX\n\n\nErase away!\n",
      "Rather than worry about securely deleting data, an alternative might be to buy a new hard drive and do a clean install of the OS on that.\n\nYou can then keep the old hard drive for a while in case you forgot to back something up and eventually recycle it as a second (or third!) drive in your new machine.\n"

      "Another suggestion, for Macs, is to use Apple's Disk Utility program. It's included on the OS X install disc, so if you boot from that, you can open Disk Utility, select your drive, and erase it (there are some options for how many times to write over data and such).\n",

      "How to reset the Windows XP Administrator password?\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n\nBoot from Windows PE or Windows Recovery Environment (or use any LiveCD/USB/ ANY Windows installation disk / Anything bootable that can see NTFS/Fat32/...), and run the Command Prompt.  \nFind the drive letter of the partition where Windows is installed. It is usually C: (Vista and XP). It could be D: under Windows 7 because the first partition contains Startup Repair and will be assigned with C:. To find the drive letter, type C: or D: and search for the Windows folder. Note that Windows PE (RE) usually resides on drive letter X.\nCreate a backup copy of sethc.exe with this command (for later restoration):\n\n\n\n(replace c: with your correct drive letter if needed)\nReplace sethc.exe with cmd.exe:\n\n\nReboot your computer and start the Windows installation where you forgot the administrator password\nAfter you see the login screen, press Shift five times or press on Accessibility.\nNow It will open a command prompt!\nEnter the following command to reset the Windows password:\n\n\n\n(If you don’t know your user name, just type net user to list all available user names)\n\n\nYou can now log on with the new password. Now you have privileges of user SYSTEM and you can do whatever you want with your current system (be careful)!\n\nAdvantages:\n\n\nIt works with all Windows versions you can find nowadays from Windows XP to 8.1, x86 or x64,\nand probably it will work on earlier and newer versions too.\nNo need to prepare anything. You can do this with any bootable media media which is in your hands at that moment. Started from MS-DOS* bootable disks and Windows installation disks to LiveCD/USB/and others.\nMany other programs that change password from registry are usable, but if something goes wrong, they can damage the OS. This method is safe and can't damage anything.\nFinally, it's free.\n\n\n*Note: If it's MS-DOS bootable media, make sure it has NTFS driver (NTFS4DOS/Paragon NTFS or something like it).\n\nNote: It works when accessibility options are enabled (5x shift, sticky keys), and its enabled by default.\n\n\n\nAnd how to prevent this?\n\nDisabling accessibility options will partially prevent this.\nPartially, because it's possible to change another files/settings and achieve the same results.  \n\nChange BIOS settings and disable booting from other devices and set BIOS password. There are some hacky methods to bypass this restriction, but it's another theme.\nFor more security, you can lock your case (really, use a real lock) to prevent BIOS reset, especially if it's a very important computer (or if you are paranoid ;)\n",

      "You could VACUUM the SQLite databases that Firefox uses to store it's history and other data. Vacuuming optimizes the database tables inside the files. That speeds up Firefox and saves you some disk space.\n\nTo vacuum the Firefox database files:\n\n\nFind the Firefox profile data directory on your system. On Windows Vista, it could be somewhere like C:\\Users\\tom\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\default.jqi\\. The directory contains files with the .sqlite extension, so you can find it by searching for those.\nGet the SQLite command line utility here.\nClose all Firefox windows. Open a command line in the profile directory.\nOn Windows, type in the command for %i in (*.sqlite) do @echo VACUUM; | sqlite3 %i\nOn Linux or Mac, run for i in *.sqlite; do echo \"VACUUM;\" | sqlite3 $i ; done\nDefragment your harddrive.\n\n\nGoogle Chrome actually uses SQLite as well, except it doesn't give the files the .sqlite extension. You can still safely run the same command for all the files in the Chrome profile directory and SQLite will only VACUUM the files it recognizes.\n",

Try clearing out your history (from a month back onwards if you'd like to keep recent history) and emptying your search history - 3.5 has a useful tool for this (that can clear up to a set date). This should speed up your query times if there's less data.\n"

Also there are things that we can do in Windows that are so difficult on Linux and vice-versa.\n\nWhich things I have to consider when going from windows to linux? Which pros and cons of using windows and using linux.\n\nThis don't want to be another windows-linux war but an objective windows-linux pros cons. For instance, linux have free upgrades, windows have more software, and so on...\n",
    "topAnswers" : [
      "As a Linux aficionado  I can only say: Give it a try, you will see what specific advantages and disadvantages it has for you.\n\nThat said: You don't primarily use an operating system, what you use is your applications.\nYou can make a list with the applications you  use most often and then decide which operating system fits your needs.\n",
      "I love Linux, but the only time that I will advise against it is when your are very heavily dependent on the software you use.\n\n\nHighly specialized CAD software and other specialty software are sometimes only available on Windows.\nIf you love Adobe products rather stick to Windows / Mac.\n\n\nWon't list any other products here, but I'm sure you get the point. Linux usually has alternatives to these products, some of them are actually VERY well maintained, but I would rather stick with the Windows alternative - sadly.\n",
      "There is no general answer to your question, that covers all aspects of such a switch.\n\nThe best way to get an overview of what to consider and prepare for such a switch, is to\n\n\nInstall applications that are available on both Windows and Linux, on your current Windows system, and try using them, and/or...\nGet a Linux live CD, or install a separate Linux test environment on your hardware as a dual install, and try it.\n\n",
      "One advantage of linux that I especially like, is that the applications become \"part of\" the system, as the system itself essentially consists of different applications (or packages, rather). That is, at least as long as the applications are installed through the system package manager. The advantage is, that everything is updated via the same system.\n\nComing from World of Windows where each application is a separate entity, distinct from the system itself, this took a while getting used to. I wanted my applications to go in some \"Programs\" folder and stay there. But after a few system updates that not only updated my system, but all of my applications as well, I realized that there's going to be no more quirky auto-updaters for each application, no need to run a \"check for updates\" from some menu, no more downloading and installing patches manually. They just update. Just like that. You do get a tiny taste of this in Windows these days as Office updates itself via Microsoft update. Now just think of that for every application.\n\nThe downside is that you might have to mess with packet repositories, which still has some quirks. You can ignore this as long as you use applications that are available in the general distribution repositories - and most are, really - but if the application isn't there, you'll need to add it's repository for it to become available. Also, at least with Ubuntu, there's quite a huge delay before completely new versions of applications, like OpenOffice 3, become available unless you add their own repositories. I hope that adding repositories some day becomes as easy as adding applications, and we can forget all the mess about manually downloading and adding authorization keys and all that.\n",
      "A fairly big gotcha is it's media capabilities. Many Linux distros don't include proprietary codecs for playing back MP3's, DVDs, etc. While you can obtain these and install them, this involves messing with your repositories, and some distros go to annoying lengths to prevent you from installing these.\n"

    "otherAnswers" : [
      "If you are thinking of making the switch from Windows to Linux my biggest piece of advice I can give you is this:\n\nconsider your hardware\n\nModern Linux distros have come a LONG way to make the user experience as easy and fun to use as you may consider Windows, but the major speed bump for most first time adopters is hardware problems.  The Linux kernel has had a lot of work go into driver management, and new drivers are being worked on and added every day, but there are still so many pieces of hardware out there that it wouldn't be too surprising for you to get at least one piece that isn't out of the box Linux ready.  \n\ni.e. on my Toshiba Satellite I have an Intel Graphics card that does work out of the box, but has some issues with showing video and doing the new UI stuff that comes with apps like Compiz, but there are a few hacks I've learned to apply to get around those.  The notebook also as a Realtek 8187b built-in wireless card, which isn't completely functional without having to install the linux-backports-modules, but then it works without any problems.\n",
      "Linux, particularly user friendly builds like Ubuntu is getting better day by day.\n\nJaunty is an excellent OS easily as good as it's commercial rivals.\n\nMy biggest beef with Linux is the hardware support is a bit behind Windows you may have to wait a while for top of the line hardware to work, particularly if the vendor has lousy FOSS support.\n\nThat said, the legacy hardware support is unmatched - hardware that stopped working for me in XP, still works in Linux.\n\nDepending what you're doing with your computer, the other major issue is software support, whilst there is software in Linux to do everything, commercial software is lagging behind.\n",
      "I've just started using Linux instead of Windows. I've still got Windows as second boot option though, to be safe. Here is what I've learned:\n\n\nIt's really difficult to choose a distro. As a non-Linux person, you have no chance. Best bet is to approach a Linux-savvy friend and use whatever he uses. \nIf that's impossible, then use Wubi (Ubuntu) because you can install it from within Windows as if it were just another Windows application. It gets you up and running within five minutes, and you are spared the talk about partitions and window managers and so on. It's really painless!\nIf you work mainly with Internet (like Gmail and Facebook) then the choice of operating system is irrelevant and you can more easily switch to Linux. But if you must use Windows because your favorite application XYZ only exists in Windows, then it's difficult to switch.\nSome Windows programs can be run inside Linux (using Wine or VirtualBox), but some can't. Apple iTunes is a famous problem because that absolutely won't run on Linux. If you have an iPhone, then you still need to keep Windows (or Mac) around, perhaps as second boot option on the same computer.\nPrepare to spend some time researching: I used to do X; I want to do Y; how does that work on Linux? Use Google, and use the support forum of the Linux variant you use - and use SuperUser, too! When you post a question, try to include as much information as possible. What is your situation, and what are you trying to achieve?\nSome hardware may not work. Your monitor may run with a lower resolution; that can usually be fixed (see previous item). Your scanner may not be supported; that requires someone to write the driver, which is often unlikely, and you won't/can't do it yourself!\nYou will be using new applications. Yes, Firefox runs in Linux, and so does Picasa. But your Quicken and iTunes and MS PowerPoint do not. Expect to learn new applications for the tasks you already perform. Be open to these changes! You may be attached to your applications because you know them well, but alternatives can sometimes be even better.\nAt first, it's daunting to solve problems. Say you want to find an application to replace your Quicken. There a million financial applications for Linux; the difficulty is figuring out which one to use.\nDon't listen to the experts too much. There are people with strong opinions about whether ACME or AJAX is best (application/system/tool/whatever), and they try to convert everyone. Such people are everywhere (Win/Mac too.) You can ignore these most of the time, except when they answer your questions (see item 5 above). Ask good questions, get good answers. If you didn't ask, don't listen, move on.\n\n",
      "In my experience, Linux makes the majority of things you do easier, but when you do encounter errors, they tend to be more difficult to resolve.\n\nBe prepared to hit the command line at times.  Be prepared for hardware compatibility issues, or the occasional heisenbug, as with Windows.\n\nOn the other hand, there's no more messing with firewall allow and deny lists, no more messing with spyware or antivirus tools, and no more defragmentation, unless you really have nothing better to do.  Even better, your distribution's package manager will automate the installation and update of all the everyday software that you use.\n\nAs a programmer, you'll have to do some things manually and perhaps settle for an editor instead of an IDE.  But the convenience of the command line easily outweighs all the hassle.\n",
      "Home users mostly uses computer for media and internet: browsing, downloading files, socializing, communicating. For these things there are almost no difference between OS. You can get your favorite browser (Opera, Firefox), Skype works fine, other instant messengers too. You can watch videos and play music too on both platforms. So if you don't need some special applications (like photoshop, or any finance software), you should feel comfortable with linux. I suggest Linux Mint at first. This distribution is based on Ubuntu, but comes with all media codecs and few other nice things. It will fit best to move from Windows.\n",
      "I've been playing around with Linux for several years and have tried at least 10 distros over that time. Now I have found Linux Mint and I love it. It just works and works well. I actually have 3 machines right now (people keep giving me their old ones). XP  Home on one, Linux Mint on another and Ubuntu 9.04 server edition (gonna try to set up one) and now that someone gave me a printer hp Photosmart I now have a printer that works with the Linux Mint. My main printer is a Canon MX 850 which I can't find a driver for. \nMore and more I am turning on the XP machine less and less. The only reason I do turn it on is because I haven't figured out how to run a couple of Fantasy Football programs on Linux. \nI think I am finally hooked and Linux Mint was the one that did it. \nThe distros, in general, just keep getting better and better and the software is fantastic.\n\nHow do I add an image when it gives me a http://? What am I supposed to do with that.\n\nLord Chumley\n",
      "If you're not really sure about making the switch to Linux, try running a distro of Linux in a VM, such as VirtualBox; it's free and allows you to work with the OS as you would have if it were installed directly on your PC.\n\nI've done this in college, because I only needed Linux for a while; I didn't want to have multiple operation systems on my PC or to completely erase Windows.\n",
      "Linux is not windows.\n\nSeriously! Linux isn't windows, it doesn't try to be windows, it shouldn't try to be windows. Things will be different, things will be scary and new, and things probably won't make much sense (/ is root? What?), but stick at it, and you'll find yourself using a powerful, fast, and easy to use machine.\n\nOh, and if I had to give you one piece of advice? Grab an IRC client and go find a channel for your distro. Forums are nice and all, but not much can compare to talking to somebody who knows how stuff works.\n\nedit: Actually, two pieces of advice. Learn to love the command line. Yeah, you can quite easily live without it for the most part, but it's still the most powerful, and flexible, UI you have.\n",
      "Take your time - make the switch-over gradually.\n\nDuring the switch-over you don't need to convert brutally from Vista to Linux : you can have them both, using Linux as an application within Windows for studying whether it supports your needs and your hardware. When you decide to abandon Windows, then you may reformat your hard disk and install only Linux.\n\nI suggest the Wubi linux distribution, since it's a variant of the very popular and easy to use Ubuntu Linux:   \n\nWubi -- an officially supported Ubuntu installer for Windows\n"

In my case ':' character was the deal breaker but took a lot of work to find this out.\n\nSo before you resume to using using a lot of parameters, I suggest follow a simple procedure:\n\n\nLocate the folder or file your zipping up.\nrun:  zip -9 -r -k zip-modified-names.zip /path/to/your/folder\npay attention to what the console spits out.  In my case ':' in file names were stripped out.\nMove the zip file to a windows machine and attempt to open it.\n\n\nIf this works, you may be better off removing the characters that have been stripped off by -k option from your file/directory names try zipping normally.  Note some parameters such as -k have side effects.  In this case -k contradicts with -q option (for sym links).\n\nAlso -k option may render your file names unreadable. In my case my files were named based on creation time (e.g. 10:55:39.pdf) to facilitate easily locating the required record from archives, but -k option turned it to 105539.pdf which is not easily readable by users.  I hence changed the names to 10_55_39.pdf which opens on Windows without using -k option but is still readable.\n"

      "Sliff is right, no os tool available. \n\nTechnically mp3 is configured such that you can split at any place you want. It uses 18 ms block of static or variable length with a certain bit combination at the beginning of each block. If you split the file in midst of a block, the player is just going to forward silently to the next block and you therefore lose a max of 18 ms.\n\nTag blocks - where you enter information about artist, title, album and such, can be at any place in the file or be ommitted. Even multiple tag blocks do not harm (the first is taken).\n\nYou can therefore split and join wherever you want.\n\nAny tool to split files would do then.\n",
      "Specialized MP3 splitters, like mp3DirectCut, cut on frame boundaries. But most MP3s use the bit reservoir to conserve space; a frame's audio data often starts in a prior frame, sometimes 2 or 3 frames back. Thus the frames near the split points are likely unplayable and are silently skipped. If the split occurs in the middle of silence, it's probably of no concern.\n\nIf the split occurs in the middle of continuous music, you might notice the skipped frames. To help mitigate this, use mp3packer to expand the mp3 to 320 kbps with minimal bit reservoir usage (-b 320 -r in.mp3 temp.mp3), make your edits in mp3DirectCut, then use mp3packer again to repack (-s -t -z temp.mp3 out.mp3). It's not guaranteed to work because bit reservoir usage might be unavoidable in a high-bitrate file, but it can help, and doesn't result in quality loss.\n\nAlternatively, you can use pcutmp3 to do the split. It preserves the necessary frames and adds gapless playback data (encoder delay &amp; padding info) to a LAME tag at the beginning of the file. Players which support this data will trim the extra samples upon playback.\n"

It is caused by a\n  synchronization issue between client\n  and server that only arises on a\n  subset of machines, possibly due to a\n  driver or 3rd party software conflict\n  that messes up the timing of the\n  Remote Desktop client.

      "A WireShark network trace showed that the freeze occurs when the Vista computer responds to a NetBios Name query with the IP address of a VMWare virtual network node instead of the primary network interface address.  The description of this VMWare virtual network is \"A private network shared with the host\".    \n\nIt further turns out that Vista's firewall classifies the VMWare Virtual Network as a \"Public Network\", and therefore blocks any attempt to access that network from other local computers.   Setting the VMWare Virtual Network as private solves the blocking issue.\n\nUpdate: Setting the Virtual network as private is only a partial fix - the virtual networks revert to public networks after a reboot.  The complete fix is to declare them as network endpoints (NDIS_DEVICE_TYPE_ENDPOINT) as demonstrated with the PowerShell script at VMWare VMNET Adapters triggering Public Profile for Windows Firewall .  As this MSDN Article shows: \n\n\n  Note: Vista automatically identifies and monitors the networks to which a computer connects. If the NDIS_DEVICE_TYPE_ENDPOINT flag is set, the device is an endpoint device and is not a connection to a true external network. Consequently, Windows ignores the endpoint device when Windows identifies networks. The Network Awareness APIs indicate that the device does not connect the computer to a network. For end users in this situation, the Network and Sharing Center and the network icon in the notification area do not show the NDIS endpoint device as connected. However, the connection is shown in the Network Connections Folder. Also, if NDIS_DEVICE_TYPE_ENDPOINT is set, the Windows Firewall ignores the connection when Windows Firewall enforces public, private, or domain policies.\n\n",

The problem is Pivot saves as animated GIFs which I can't upload to YouTube.\n\nThe Wikipedia article recommends using Windows Movie Maker to convert GIF to WMV, but unfortunately I'm using Windows 7 for which you can get the new Windows Live Movie Maker which doesn't seem to support GIFs.\n\nI Googled and found an article which said to use Beneton Movie GIF to convert animated GIF to AVI, but this seemed to rely on a 3rd Party application which wasn't installed and so failed.  Installing the missing application - pjBmp2Avi - by hand and adding it to the path still didn't allow Beneton to do the conversion.\n\nI hoped FFmpeg might do the trick but this only outputs to animated GIFs, it won't read from then.\n\nFurther Googling found lots of applications with 30 day trials and so on but I was hoping for something free.\n\nSo any suggestions on how I can convert an animated GIF to a movie file on Windows using free (as in beer) software?\n",

If you have more digits, then use the following syntax, for example with 4 digits:\n\n\n\nYou could then use FFmpeg to build those into a movie.\n\n\n\nTo change the quality of the resulting video, add the -crf option, e.g. -crf 23, where lower means better quality. Sane values are between 18 and 28, but since the GIF quality shouldn't be too good in the first place, you probably won't need this option.\n\nAs of 2013, recent versions of ffmpeg can accept animated gifs as input directly.\n\n\n",

I always put the Home directory in it's own partition and judging by the amount of questions about it on the net it's a popular question with Windows too.  Symlinks are probably the best, cleanest and easiest way to do this.

Corporately an AD user profile or GPO can redirect the My Docs folder to a NAS/SAN or other network share.  Simple reeasons - backups are handled by the data centre or systems guys and not end users, and the PC isn't THEIR PC anyway - it's the company's (so is the data, btw) - so if it dies give them another PC to log in to and they carry on as they were within minutes.\n\nAt home, I want to put it on a seperate disk/partition.  If my OS fails I want the user data unaffected - makes restores quicker and you also end up with a less fragmented disk as user data changes all the time.\n\nBTW - I also use mirrored disks - having a 1TB+ drive at home is great but it's an awful lot of data to loose if it goes pop!  AND you end up with a lot of data to back up unless you use incremental - which is a pain in the arse to recover!

    "question" : "I have a Dell Latitude D820 that I've owned for about 2.5 years.  It is a Core 2 Duo T7200 2.0GHz, with 2 GB of RAM, an 80 GB hard drive and an NVidia Quadro 120M video card.\n\nThe computer was purchased in late November of 2006 with XP Pro, and included a free upgrade to Vista Business.  (Vista was available on MSDN but not yet via retail, so the Vista Business upgrades weren't shipped until March of '07.)  Since we had an MSDN subscription at the time, I installed Vista Ultimate on it pretty much as soon as I got it.\n\nIt ran happily until sometime in the spring of 2007 when Media Center (which I had never used except to watch DVDs) started throwing some kind of bizarre SQL (CE?) error.  This error would pop up at random times just while using the computer.  Furthermore, Media Center would no longer start.  I never identified the cause of this error.\n\nI had the Vista Business upgrade by this time, so I nuked the machine, installed XP and all the drivers, and then the Vista Business upgrade.  Again, it ran happily for a few months and then started behaving badly once again.  Vista Business doesn't have Media Center, so this exhibited completely unrelated symptoms.  For no apparent reason and at fairly random times, the machine would suddenly appear to freeze up or run very slowly.  For example, launching a new application window (any app) might take 30-45 seconds to paint fully.  However, Task Manager showed very low CPU load, memory, etc.  I tried all the normal stuff (chkdsk, defrag, etc.) and ran several diagnostic programs to try to identify any problems, but none found anything.  It eventually reached the point that the computer was all but unusable, so I nuked it again and installed XP.  This time I decided to stick with XP instead of going to Vista.  However, within the past couple of months it has started to exhibit the same symptoms in XP that I used to see in Vista.\n\nThe computer is still under Dell warranty until December, but so far they aren't any help unless I can identify a specific problem.\n\nA friend (partner in a now-dead business) has an identical machine that was purchased at the same time.  His machine exhibits none of these symptoms, which leads me to believe it is a hardware issue, but I can't figure out how to identify it.  Any ideas?  Utilities?  Seen something similar?  At this point I can't even identify any pattern to the behavior, but would be willing to run a \"stress test\"-style app for as long as a couple days if I had any hope that it would find something.\n\nEDIT July 17\n\nI'm testing jerryjvl's answer regarding the video card, though I'm not sure it fully explains the symptoms yet.  This morning I ran a video stress test.  The test itself ran fine, but immediately afterward the PC started acting up again.  I left ProcExp open and various system processes were consuming 50-60% of the CPU but with no apparent reason.  For example, \"services.exe\" was eating about 40%, but the sum of its child processes wasn't higher than about 5%.  I left it alone for several minutes to settle down, and then it was fine again.  I used the \"video card stability test\" from firestone-group.com.  Its output isn't very detailed, but it at least exercises the hardware pretty hard.\n\nEDIT July 22\n\nThanks for your excellent suggestions.  Here is an update on what I have tried so far.\n\n\nRan memtest86, SeaTools (Seagate), Hitachi drive fitness test, video card stability test (mentioned above).  The video card test was the only one that seemed to produce any results, though it didn't occur during the actual test.\nI defragged the drive (again...) with JkDefrag\nI dropped the video card ",

    "acceptedAnswer" : "It's unlikely that the whole machine will die, but if there's anything still in file write buffers, you'll lose that data... and basically the machine probably won't know the difference between you powering it off and it shutting down due to a power cut.\n\nServices won't get the chance to shut themselves down cleanly. For instance, if you're running a web server, when it gets asked to shut down it may well complete any existing requests (with a timeout) rather than the connection just going away.\n\nThe \"file write buffer\" doesn't just have to be the Windows buffer, either. Again taking a web server example, the logging might be buffered so it only writes to disk every 100 requests or something similar. A clean shutdown will flush this appropriately; a hard shutdown won't.\n\nIf you have online services, a clean shutdown may sign you out of them appropriately, instead of the service thinking you could just have network problems.\n\nBasically think of anything a system might want to do when closing down in terms of either the on-board disks or connections to other systems (such as network connections) - all of those are going to be happier when shut down properly.\n",

Unfortunately, theses scans can take anyware from several hours to several days depending on the size and condition of the drive and the level at which you run SpinRite.\n\nI have an ESATA drive dock and I have been able to get SpinRite to work in a VMware Workstation VM by giving VMware direct access to the drive in the dock, thus allowing me to continue to use the host computer while the SpinRite VM cranks away.

I'd try to invest in a faster model.

      "I think the only way you can downgrade an existing Vista to XP is to install XP over it. They're completely different operating systems under the hood.\n",
      "It is possible to get rid of Vista and go to XP.\n\nIf you have a license for XP, creating a Virtual Machine is the easiest way to go.  You can get Virtual PC for a free solution, or preferably get VMWare Workstation and go that route.  This way you won't have to mess with backing stuff op on your Vista machine.\n\nIf you have no need for Vista then you will basically have to start from scratch by installing XP as a clean install over the Vista partition.  Be sure to back up anything pertinent first.  It is similar to installing XP normally, you just need to format the Vista partition first.\n\nIf you decide to go that route here is a link describing how to do it:\n\nhttp://windowssecrets.com/2009/03/12/01-Downgrade-Vista-to-XP-in-seven-easy-steps\n"

      "The short answer is: You need to use a 64bit OS in order to use all 4GB of memory.\n\nPart of the reason is that though there's a 4GB address space in a 32-bit system, other things than the main RAM need some of the address space - the graphics card's memory being a big one.\n\nThere's a good explanation at Coding Horror.\n",
      "Some chipsets/BIOS only allocated 3.2 GB of RAM. I'm also using a Dell Inspiron E1705 and a Dell Precision M6300 with 2x2GB RAM, but the system can only use 3.2 GB because part of the RAM is allocated for hardware that needs memory address space.\n\nA copy-paste from http://members.cox.net/slatteryt/RAM.html:\n\n\"Certain components within the computer require address space in the 4-GB range. Any address space reserved for these components cannot be used by computer memory.\nThe following components require memory address space:\n\n\nSystem ROM\nAPIC(s)\nIntegrated PCI devices, such as network connectors and SCSI controllers\nPCI cards\nGraphics card\nPCI Express cards (if applicable)\n\n\nAt start-up, the BIOS identifies the components that require address space. The BIOS dynamically calculates the amount of reserved address space required. The BIOS then subtracts the reserved address space from 4 GB to determine the amount of usable space.\n\nIf the total installed computer memory is less than the usable space, all installed computer memory is available for use only by the operating system.\"\n\nIf the total installed computer memory is equal to or greater than the usable address space, a small portion of installed memory is unavailable for use by the operating system.\"\n\nHopes this helps to understand. Sometimes it helps to enable PAE (Physical Address Extension), but not all motherboards/chipsets support this. Check Wikipedia for more detailed information.\n",
      "You can enable Physical Address Extension (PAE) to solve this issue.

My HTPC does need a decent processor to play Blu-Ray and other 1080p content, but at the same time, it is not on all the time, and it doesn't have much disk wise.  So my machines don't have much overlap.\n\nPartly, this is because I do not use the HTPC as a DVR.  If I did, I might have different needs, although a good argument could be made that the recording side of your DVR should be on your WHS.\n",

      "I have tried literally dozens of duplicate file finders (I still have the installers/ZIP files for about 20 of them sitting around). I used CloneMaster 2.19 for a time because it was the best one I could find, though even that wans’t perfect (I wanted one that could also detect duplicate MP3s by audio content, ignoring the tags). All of them had problems that frustrated me enough that I decided to write my own and laid out a list of the features I demand of a DFF.\n\nAnd then I found AllDup. It is the first and only one that actually made me abandon a project (technically mine isn’t completely abandoned, it’s just no longer being worked on since I don’t need to write it anymore because AllDup does everything I want of it). Anyway, AllDup searches for duplicate files, but unlike the others, it uses a lot of the tricks and techniques that I was going to use in my own DFF. As such, it is very fast: it can for example scan >250,000 of sizes from 1B-5GB in ~30mins (I have done it on my system several times).\n\nAnother great (and for some reason rare) feature of AllDup is as I mentioned that it can scan for duplicate MP3s by their actually audio data while ignoring tags, so two MP3s that are the same but have differing tags (very common when downloading) will be detected as duplicates. (It could even detect when I ripped two identical songs from two different CDs—with different tags of course.) Of course it can detect dupes based on other factors besides byte-for-byte content, like filenames, dates, etc.\n\nOther great features of AllDup include the ability to filter (include or exclude) based on filename and/or folder name and/or filesize. The results screen is also very versatile with options to select files based on date, path, name, this, that, the other… It also has variety in what to do with detected duplicates\n\nMichael Thummerer is also very receptive.

    "question" : "A Vista virtual machine I use only has a 10 GB virtual hard disk -- and I'm worried about it running out of space over time.\n\nI used TreeSize to check for the culprits..\n\n\n\nAnd the primary culprit is that /winsxs or \"Windows Side-By-Side\" folder.\n\n\n\nWhat is the Windows Side By Side folder? Well, that's explained pretty well here.\n\n\n  All of the components in the operating system are found in the WinSxS folder – in fact we call this location the component store.  Each component has a unique name that includes the version, language, and processor architecture that it was built for.  The WinSxS folder is the only location that the component is found on the system, all other instances of the files that you see on the system are “projected” by hard linking from the component store.  Let me repeat that last point – there is only one instance (or full data copy) of each version of each file in the OS, and that instance is located in the WinSxS folder.   So looked at from that perspective, the WinSxS folder is really the entirety of the whole OS, referred to as a \"flat\" in down-level operating systems.  This also accounts for why you will no longer be prompted for media when running operations such as System File Checker (SFC), or when installing additional features and roles.\n  \n  That explains why the folder starts off big, but not why it gets larger over time – the answer to that question is servicing.   In previous versions of Windows the atomic unit of servicing was the file, in Windows Vista it’s the component.  When we update a particular binary we release a new version of the whole component, and that new version is stored alongside the original one in the component store.  The higher version of the component is projected onto the system, but the older version in the store isn’t touched.  The reason for that is the third part of why the component store gets so large.\n\n\nLots of other people complaining about the size of the /winsxs folder, too:\n\n\n  A coworker recently received his every two year work laptop refresh and was in the middle of loading his new laptop with Vista. For some reason, his hard drive C: was partitioned to only 25GB and the rest of the space reserved for a much larger drive D:.\n  \n  Anyway, after loading many Windows Updates, he was left with hardly any drive space left on C:, and for some reason, the WinSxS directory had ballooned to over 8GB.\n  \n  While I knew what the WinSxS (Windows Side-by-Side) directory was for, I wasn't quite sure why that directory would explode in size so fast with normal operating system updates.\n\n\nI don't really care about having all these duplicate files for safety, but I do care about the VM exploding due to an out of disk space error. So.. can /winsxs be safely pared down in any way? It doesn't seem that it can be.. \n\n\n  Administrators should not, for any reason, take it upon themselves to clean out the /winsxs directory - doing so may prevent Windows Update and MSI from functioning properly afterwards.  Preventing accidental deletion from the directory is accomplished by putting a strong security descriptor on the directory that inherits to its children.\n\n\nIf this /winsxs folder gets any larger, I'm going to have to re-image this virtual machine.. which I really don't want to do!\n",

      "There is a nice command that cleans up after a Windows 7 SP1 installation (it saved me around 3&nbsp;GB):\n\n\n\nMust be executed from an elevated command prompt\n",
      "TL;DR\n\nwinsxs actually contains hard links (which are kind of like 'shortcuts level 2') -- it does not take up as much additional data as you think. (You would not gain as much space as you think if you delete it.)\n\n\n\nwinsxs is not a problem\n\n...it's a solution! (Well, mostly.)\n\nA summary, \"Marked As Answer by Ronnie Vernon, MVP, Moderator\", says here:\n\n\n  Wow, long discussion about hardlinks and winsxs. Anyway here are some\n  summarized points of what I understood about how all of it works.\n  \n  To start by answering the OP's question with the perfect answer posted\n  above by Andre.Ziegler, you don't touch winsxs. Maybe some of the\n  files can be trimmed like the mp3's, avi's, etc but the rest of the\n  system files should be left alone. I too am using Link Shell Extension\n  as posted above by Ronnie Vernon, easy way to see which are hard\n  linked (red arrow) and which are simple files.\n  \n  Before getting here I saw in a lot of places people asking for the\n  cleanup tool after installing SP1 for Windows 7 like vsp1cln. There is\n  no dedicated tool, it all got integrated into the Disk Cleanup\n  service. One note that I would make here is that even if the option\n  says it will remove a few hundreds of MB after I cleaned up my drive\n  the service removed around 3GB of excess files, so it varies from\n  system to system. Funny, now I have even more space than I had before\n  installing SP1. Nice one, MS.\n  \n  Regarding the hard links, I got amused by the confusion created around\n  them. I'm not a linux geek, and I usually use only soft links...\n  they're enough for me, but people didn't get how the hard ones work\n  and how size is counted.\n  \n  A group of selected files, links or not, will always be counted as a\n  sum. This means that if I take a 10MB file, and make 2 hard links, the\n  selection of all three of them will have 30MB and this is the correct\n  size, because unlike the soft links which are related to the file's\n  original Master File Table entry and have 0 bytes, hard links are\n  related to the data itself, have their own entry in MFT but point to\n  the same data address, obviously having as size the size of the actual\n  data, same times, attributes and so on. Why, below.\n  \n  How much is left on the drive? Simple: exactly as much as the drive's\n  own properties reports. Don't go selecting all the files, hidden and\n  non hidden on C and making comparisons, or using tools that do that\n  automatically because it won't show the actual HDD usage. Why?\n  Because:\n  1. that operation makes a list of all the selected files including hard links as separate files, takes each of them and adds the sizes\n  up, the drives properties counts the actual stored data\n  2. not all the files will be counted, folders protected from traversing and files from reading will not be counted and the System\n  Volume Information usually has very large files protected just in this\n  manner\n  3. that number is useful only in cases of file transfer, if the files, links, etc need to be copied to DVD or NAS, that's how much they would\n  occupy, and the links will not be preserved since they are NTFS\n  specific features, not available or available in different forms under\n  ISO, UDF, NFS and other file systems, but they will be cloned.\n  \n  Make a test... copy a 10MB file, a.exe, from a different drive and\n  notice how the free space drops by the 10MB. Make a hard link (mklink\n  /H b.exe a.exe). Now these two files selected will \"use\" 20MB in the\n  selection properties, but actually only 10MB verified at the drive's\n  properties, which will have the same free space as it did/does after\n  the file copy. Delete one, either one, the free space will remain the\n  same. Now delete the last one and the space will increase by 10MB. Was\n  there any harm done? NO.\n  \n  What is winsxs? A much better dllcache. Where with the dllcache in XP\n  we had copies of files that actually added to the size usage since\n  they were cloned, this actually improves usage but not total\n  protection (against viruses). If a rogue uninstaller thinks it has to\n  remove some runtime libs from System32, it would only delete the\n  links, but not the data, then the links would be recreated while\n  keeping data space usage at lowest possible, better than archiving\n  winsxs in cabs and having the cabs along side the original files. Also\n  winsxs bring serialization, compartmentalizing files with the same\n  name but different version, for the dev's sake, which is a good thing\n  / bad thing, it makes them lazy to code properly but it helps when\n  they don't want to code anymore.\n  \n  I did this to help anyone that lands here out of the same reasons I\n  did... excessive \"usage of space\" by winsxs after SP1. And I hope it\n  was helpful.\n\n",

It is one Batch file written by Christian Bering Boegh and available for download at their Google Code site.\n  \n  Before running the WinSXSLite, we personally advise that you take a full system backup of your windows partition by using any of the backup utility. I use CloneZilla for this because it is free and Open Source. Once Backup is taken you can run.\n  \n  WinSXSLite is split into 2 phases, the first phase will search the files which are identical in size with the files stored in WinSXS folder and as per program can be removed. This is required because with a lot of Files backed up by MS Windows are actually not changing but stored as backup in WinSXS folder and resulting in huge size of Folder.\n  \n  Second Phase will replace all version of each and every file stored in WinSXS folder and will create hard link to highest version of file in program location or other location. So that if any other program look for File it can be found and at the same time There is no actual file but only Directory entries for the file.\n  \n  This way we can remove the files after making hard links and Still MS windows will think that it has the file backed up in WinSXS folder. Only disadvantage of this process will be that you can restore back your System files, but that you anyway don’t want if you need space recovered, because for having restoration utility to work you must have back up copy.\n\n\nProgram Download\n",

    "acceptedAnswer" : "Been hunting around the net after the tip from KovBal about dynamic disks - and came across this thread.\n\nBasically, RAID using external USB hard drives doesn't look too achievable.\n\nOne quote here.\n\n\n  Using USB as the transfer technology\n  you're only going to achieve a\n  30-Megabyte or less transfer rate. You\n  seem to be going to a lot of effort\n  for a marginal result. For external\n  use, eSATA is a much better choice for\n  performance.\n  \n  Maybe I don't understand the intent,\n  but having 3 USB external drives\n  working as a single \"Dynamic\" volume\n  is almost certainly going to saturate\n  the Hubs/Controller they are on.\n\n\nAnd another quote here.\n\n\n  The overhead of software RAID will\n  probably cause problems on USB drives.\n  Even if you get it working I think it\n  will probably be flaky and error\n  prone. You can buy USB enclosures that\n  you can install multiple drives in.\n  These enclosures use an embedded Linux\n  so that you can then setup a RAID\n  array. This way the RAID calculations\n  and read/writes are all done outside\n  of Windows. The interface can be USB,\n  SCSI, eSATA, LAN, whatever, it makes\n  no difference. Software RAID is a\n  compromise at best. I don't believe\n  RAID 5 is supported in Vista in any\n  case. I would look for a different way\n  to achieve your goal.\n\n",
    "topAnswers" : [
      "This might be done with dynamic disks. I'm not sure if an USB hard drive can be converted to a dynamic disk, but this seems to be the only way to this. Once you converted your HDDs to dynamic disks you can create all kinds of RAID volumes. If your HDDs' sizes aren't equal, you can still use JBOD, so you can have them all in the same file system.\n\nHowever, only Vista Enterprise and Ultimate supports dynamic disks.\n",

      "The biggest downside with an actual RAID is that all the disks involved should be the same size or else it treats all other drives as the same size of the smallest drive. (eg. 2 x 20 GB drives and 1 x 100GB drive) will result in a 60 GB possible capacity - 3 x 20GB)\n\nOne of the advantages of ZFS (which has support in mostly server OSes, and not r/w on Windows and only read only by default on Mac OS X) is that you can mix and match drives and it shows them as one pool. \n"

    "question" : "I've got a laptop running Windows XP (too old to upgrade) and it does something that's maddeningly frustrating: every now and then, I find my network connectivity has disappeared. If I go to my \"Wireless Networks\" window, I see that my access point is listed, except where it should say \"Connected\" it just says \"Automatic.\"\n\nThis is where I curse my computer and ask, \"If it's Automatic, then why aren't you automatically trying to reconnect!?\"\n\nSo then I double-click the access point's listing, and I get the \"Type in the password for this access point\" box, except the password field is blank. It shouldn't be, because Windows knows the password.\n\nSo I click Cancel without typing anything in.\n\nThen it automatically refreshes the list of available access points. This time, it automatically connects and doesn't need to ask me for the password because it already knows it.\n\nI have to do this like five times a day. Is there a workaround? If not, is there some open source or non-crappy freeware that replaces Windows XP's crappy WiFi subsystem with one that actually remembers passwords all the time and actually tries to reconnect to my home LAN all the time?\n\nP.S. This isn't, \"Oh, maybe you walked out of range or the access point had a hiccup and so Windows tried once to reconnect and it timed out.\" I'm usually using the computer when it happens and flip over to the Networks window (which I now keep open all the time) within about a second, and it's already in \"Automatic\" mode.

    "question" : "Most laptops have a CD eject that is very sensitive, and placed such that it regularly gets triggered when handling the laptop. This is in particular a problem (for clumsy-handed me) when picking up the laptop to stow in in a laptop bag; I've lost count of the number of times it has ejected just as I am lowering it into the case!\n\nI rarely use a CD, but I am wondering whether some crafty software hack (or other trick) might be possible to make it less vulnerable. Perhaps trying to fool it into thinking it is busy (but ideally without destroying my battery).\n\nOtherwise, I might as well bow to the inevitable and snap the darned thing off.\n\nI'm not making this brand-specific, as I've seen this problem on a range of both branded and re-badged laptops. I am, however, mainly interested in windows-friendly solutions.\n",

      "Woohoh! score: CD/DVD Drive Locker (systray app). Works like a charm, and doesn't cause it to spin.\n",
      "There are several ways you work through this problem.\n\nFirstly I would say just disabling the drive entirely is really not the right option here. So let us explore some other options.\n\nI would consider is to use a small piece of software that is capable of locking the drive.  This can be done in software which is well evident during those times the drive won't let you eject the disk.  I have not tried to do this kind of thing specifically but I am sure this is possible if you can write a little code.  You might be able to find a small systray app for this kind of thing already off the shelf.\n\nThe second suggestion I would make would be to remove the drive and inspect the eject control mechanism.  In many cases it uses a sub-miniature surface mount single pole, single throw switch like the ones used in the right and left buttons on a standard mouse. This configuration gives you two obvious options I can think of.  One is to install a small toggle switch somewhere inside the drive that can sever the trace to the eject button.  Controlling the problem electrically is great however there is a question of whether there is enough room inside the device for anything extra and also if you have the soldering/assembly skills to pull this modification off properly. A screw up with this method could render the drive a hunk of slag. An easier method would be to find the end of the plastic button for the drive eject.  Once you find the spot where the button and the switch meet, you can use some sandpaper to take off a small amount of material until the button is sufficiently resistant to being accidently activated.  Be very careful here because removing too much material will render the button permanently disabled.\n",

Also I found this.\n"

    "question" : "I'm considering setting up a dual boot configuration with a RAID 10 setup , provided by the motherboard - Gigabyte GA-EP35-DS4.\n\nWill there be any issues with set up considering that I plan on dual-booting Linux and Windows XP with it?\n",
    "acceptedAnswer" : "These desktop motherboards provide software RAID. This means that they make possible to boot the RAID volume, but after that a driver does the work. The OS has to support the specific RAID application.\n\nBooting from such a software RAID volume is at least tricky under Linux. Windows isn't a big issue since you've got drivers with your motherboard.\n\nHowever, if you use software RAID you can't use hibernation.\n\nAll in all, if you can install Linux to the volume then I say you're good to go. Maybe the Linux bootloader will mess things up, but I doubt it.\n"

But this network doesn't have a name (it's only \"Unidentified network\"), and the name doesn't distinguish between the adapters (which have different IP subnets - this machine acts like a router).\n\nRe the backup task and network presence: in a Task Scheduler's Task properties, the Conditions tab has an option: \"Start only if the following network connection is available\". However, I can't get my Gigabit Wired adapter to show up as a network in the dropdown here.\n\nSo, how can I name my network connections / subnets / adapters appropriately to wire up with scheduled task conditions?\n",

It's a low end Toshiba running Vista Home Premium.  \n\nWhen she got it I went through and uninstalled most of the OEM-ed crap that came on it and it ran fine.  While there are a few extra things installed now there's not enough to account for the impact.\n\nMy feeling is that rather than it being a specific issue this is the inevitable Windows performance degredation over time.\n\nI've used Windows in one form or another since 3.1 but have never really understood why this is or how to prevent or treat it.\n\nCan anyone tell me why it happens and, critically, whether there is anything (short of a full reinstall) I can do about it - either preventative or a cure?\n\n(And I've tried selling her on another OS but she's 65 and for now wants to stick with what she knows, particularly when she's only had 9 months use out of a machine).\n",

OTOH disk fragmentation accounts for only a small part of the slow down. I have come up with this approach:\n\nWhenever someone in my family buys a new computer, I spend one or two hours doing what you did: deleting all the unnecessary crap. \nI clean up everything that I can find, install the latest service packs and security updates for Windows, Office etc, and I move the My Documents folder to a seperate drive. *)\n\nThen I install an old version of Acronis TrueImage that came for free with a computer magazine some years ago. (I think it's version 7, it came with a license to use for free for personal uses, as many installations as I wanted, so i am legally in the clear here ;-) I take an image of the whole system drive and store it on the drive with the user documents.\n\nEvery now and then, my mom, dad, sister, cousin or whatever will complain that their computers are getting slooooooow... I tell them that I can restore the old image, but they will have to reinstall all other programs they installed after I took the image. \n\nSo far, everyone has acceptesd this. I restore the old image, and they have to spend an additional hour or two reinstalling all their pet programs (thus starting to make the system slow again ;-)\n\n\n\n*) yes yes, I know... better to store the image on a seperate physical drive than on another partition, but hey - you have to balance benefit against effort\n",
      "One thing that people don't think about is that the version of the OS that comes installed (or you install) on a your machine; Definitely isn't the same version you're running years later!\n\nUpdates, Security patches, Service packs will have replaced numerous, if not most, of the software that was originally installed.   And these replacements will be bigger more robust version fixing issues or adding features, that inevitable slow your computer down.\n\ndoes anyone know of a performance comparison between Windows XP RTM and the current SP3 version patched up-do-date?\n\nI wonder!\n",

The most obvious changes was that previously on boot I'd arrive at the XP Welcome screen, only to have to wait between 10 and 30 seconds before the login prompt became available. Afterwards that wait was down to 1 or 2 seconds.\n\nThe tool has other bells and whistles (scheduling etc.), but I recommend it to friends and family based purely on the SmartPlacement stuff.

There are plenty of tutorials out there that will help you out, though.  If you don't want to risk needing to compile programs, your best bet would probably be to stick with 32 bit.\n\nOverall, it's not that hard to get used to compiling programs every so often, but running 64 bit, it becomes a little more necessary.\n"

      "My first instinct would be to call the activation phone line and try to speak with someone regarding the issue.  MS customer support is generally quite good at resolving issues such as this.\n\nKB article with additional activation information\n\nEDIT:  Since it's OEM, you might actually need to contact your hardware supplier to get this issue resolved.  There's a known bug in Vista where sometimes computers that do not require activation (like OEM installations), suddenly require it.  Sounds like it might be applicable to your situation.\n",
      "Microsoft checks your Vista serial against a list of known leaked serials (corporate edition keys, etc). Evidently, your serial matches one of them so it decides that you're using counterfeit software.\n\nThe only way you can make your system legit is to get in touch with an OEM support person. The OEM supplier should normally be indicated by a sticker on your computer case.\n\nYou can not make your system legit. The most you can do is turn off the nag warning. But beware that you're then considered as a counterfeiter, and that Windows Update will not be fully functioning.\n\nUntil you get somebody to give you a new serial, here's how I believe you would get rid of the nag. I suggest that you create first a system restore point, just in case.\n\n\n  Reboot to safe mode. Open up\n  HijackThis and scroll down to the\n  selection that says “020 – Winlogon\n  Nofity: Wgalogon – …” select that, and\n  click Fix checked.\n  \n  You can also go and rename the actual\n  executable that nags you. The full\n  path to it should be (for most\n  installs)\n  C:\\Windows\\System32\\wgatray.exe.\n  \n  Reboot.\n\n\nTry first to see if the second step is enough (followed by a reboot), because it can be easily undone once you get your legit serial number.\n"

Plus, if you find someone in your area, you can opt for local-pickup and meet them in person to examine it yourself and save on shipping.\n\nAnother option is online classifieds. That way, you can meet the seller in person and examine it as with a local-pickup. Many countries have Kijiji (renamed to eBay Classifieds in the USA) and others that don't usually have some sort of local counterpart. It is indispensable because it greatly helps to reduce waste by making it easier for people to buy and sell locally. I highly recommend it for general use.\n"

    "question" : "Windows has lacked Virtual desktop since it's origin (although Windows 1.0 had a tiling window manager :), and has required always the use of a third party application or a PowerToy (Windows XP+).\n\nDoes anyone know why this is the case? Do people in Redmond think it's bad? Is it too hard for new users to grasp the idea? Any other explanation?\n",
    "acceptedAnswer" : "Windows had Virtual Desktop support in its API since at least Windows NT 41. There were multiple 3rd-party programs that made use of it, although some resorted to hiding/showing windows and keeping track of the desktops themselves.\n\nAs for why MS never included such a tool, I can only speculate, but is that something you'd sell the average customer and he'd be like \"Oh gosh, I really can use this\"? Heck, even I as a pretty computer-literate user never got used to multiple desktops. I simply doubt it'd be a feature the majority of users would want and/or use.\n\nAlso, not including such a tool should definitely cut down on the \"Where are my windows gone?\" questions the support people have to answer.\n\n\n\n1 I am only talking about the NT line of operating systems, as the API on Win 9x was very different and much more limited.\n",
    "topAnswers" : [
      "As someone pointed out, the API to support this feature has been around since the days of WIndows NT.\n\nHowever, Microsoft did implement virtual desktops themselves, since at least the launch of Windows XP. It's an optional Windows XP Powertoy download called Virtual Desktop Manager.\n\nYou can still download it at the Microsoft PowerToys for Windows XP website.\n\n\n  Direct download link :\n  Deskman.exe\n\n\n\n\nNonetheless, Microsoft never promoted it and very few people know about it until this day.\nI've used it for a couple of years when I was using Windows XP and it was pretty good (and free too).\n\n\n\n\n  Update (since the questions has changed):  Last year, the Microsoft\n  Sysinternals team released Desktops\n  1.0  which will supersede Virtual Desktop Manager (MSVDM):\n  Microsoft releases Desktops, new virtual desktop manager\n  \n  Short of getting hold a Windows\n  program manager to tell us the\n  rationale, I guess we can infer from\n  the release of MSVDM as a Powertoy and\n  now Desktops as a Sysinternals tool\n  that Microsoft thinks that virtual\n  desktops are only of interest to, or\n  suitable for highly technical users.\n  Microsoft describes its Sysintersnals\n  as targeting the \"IT Pro or a\n  developer\".\n\n",
      "I imagine it was simply a case of:\n\n\nUsers not requiring it in most cases\nThose that do could do so with 3rd party software. Some of which Microsoft sold (don't want to undercut their own products now)\nGiven the above they probably judged it a waste of development resources.\n\n",
      "I think it's one of those things that are hard to get exactly right. \n\nFirst of all, most users won't have a need for it at all, so they'll just never use it. This is probably the main reason why MS never made an effort here. \n\nFor the remaining users, you need to be very careful in order to make them really trust the mechanism. All virtual desktop tools I have used on windows have some issue that breaks the trust. Windows suddenly moving to other desktops or just disappearing, notifications not appearing, delays in drawing the taskbar, etc. \n\nOn the mac there is a sliding animation when you move between desktops so that you have a feeling of moving in physical space. This is not just a visual effect, it speaks to the brain in a fundamental way that makes it easier to remember (more like \"feel\") where you and your different windows are. \n\nYou also have an easy way to see all desktops and move windows between them, and there are just no unexpected strange issues with the whole thing. No strange pauses, no weird re-draws of windows, no stutters or stops. It doesn't feel like a \"hack\", and I think this is essential in order to make people use it.\n",

    ],
    "otherAnswers" : [
      "The standard answer for features that don't exist is that it takes a lot of effort to create them, they don't just appear in the OS for free. By effort I mean both time &amp; money for the development &amp; support of the said feature.\n\nAt the same time, there are probably a lot of other features that people might want at some point - since neither money or time are infinite you can only get some of the features and not others. I guess 'virtual desktops' keeps loosing the priority game for each OS version.\n",
      "Not everyone appreciates Virtual desktops and even though there are applications that replicate the behaviour on Windows machines there seems to be very few that actually uses something like it. Even while I was on Linux I tried it out for a while but without multiple monitors to keep the desktops on I didn't really see the point, myself. So my answer is that the users they tested it on didn't find it useful so they didn't include it, simple as that.\n",
      "Isn't the whole point of Windows to have multiple \"Windows\" open at the same time? \n\nThe only time this really get's annoying having to many Windows open, is when you can't Alt + Tab straight to your music player or you have to skim through 20 Internet Explorer pages (back in IE6) to get somewhere without touching the mouse.\n\nI think that if I would then spread my \"work\" around multiple desktops, it would still be a nightmare since there never was a great solution for quick switching if you have too much of the same open (lots of browser tabs and lots of Word docs for instance).\n\nPlus I mostly keep my desktop clean, so no need for more desktop space.\n\nAh well, we probably all got used to not having it too much...\n",
      "As stated above it's existed in XP as a powertoy (i.e. targeted at pro users) since early this decade.\n\nPredating that, I distinctly recall using a virtual desktop tool in Windows 9.x (I think it was part of the 95 or 98 \"plus\" pack) for a good few years in the 90s.\n\nSo is the answer actually \"it didn't\"?\n"

Amazon just bought the company so you know it's solid (http://www.ivona.com/us/news/amazoncom-announces-acquisition-of-ivona-software/).\n\nThey work with Microsoft's SAPI interface which means the voices are available to any program that supports that (e.g. Adobe Reader).  I've been using them with Text To Wav program which is nice for bulk conversion of text files into wave files.\n\nEdit\n\nActually just re-read your question and I think for non-personal use (e.g. podcasts) the price is probably a lot higher for IVONA.

    "question" : "Hey guys, I currently do CMD + K in Finder to connect to my Windows computer to be able to browse and use its network shares (i.e. smb://MyPC). It works fine, but sometimes when I click on it, maybe after having the MacBook go to sleep, it sits there loading and it stays that way, it doesn't show the list of shares anymore. What I want to do is obviously unmount the 'computer' (I know I didn't mount the computer, but how else can I say it) so that I can re-connect using the same method. I click on the eject button on the left, but then it says that:\n\n\n  A disk on \"MyPC\" is in use and could not be ejected.\n  \n  Try quitting applications and try again.\n\n\nThe only way I have managed to get this to work again is by restarting my MacBook, but that should not be necessary. I already tried disconnecting my internet (Turning Airport Off, then back on) but it does not do anything. I'm wondering if perhaps there is a terminal command or something I can do to force this to be off.\n\nAnd no, I am not running anything that is using anything from the network shares, unless for some reason, an application I was using earlier and quit did not 'give the handle back', and I doubt this is the case, but if it is, is there also a terminal command to see if any program is accessing/using any file/folder at a certain path?\n\nHope I can get this fixed, I would appreciate any help. Gotta go and restart my MacBook now :(\n",

    "acceptedAnswer" : "I've been having this problem for a while now also, but the force unmount turned out to work when applied to the other dead network mount (I had two network mounted that had wedged themselves somehow). I'm not sure if this is just due to a change in the OS at some point (I'm on 10.6.4 atm.), and the unmount command required the full path (as in sudo umount -f /Volumes/Share) because it could not resolve the path properly otherwise and would get stuck anyway.\n\nOnce the wedged mount was removed the finder restarted finally (I'd killed it without it restarting properly), and the other mount was removable at that point too (I had another terminal hung trying to unmount that drive so I'm not sure which happened first).\n\nIn my case I couldn't reboot without the reboot cycle getting wedged also forcing me to use the powerbutton to turn the machine off.\n\nThis solution comes from a blog post, which also contained the steps needed to diagnose which volume to unmount first.\n\n\n  So the steps to solve the issue would\n  be:\n  \n  \n  Run “lsof” in terminal \n  See about what smb mounts it complaints \n  sudo umount -f [any_failing_smb_mount] \n  \n\n\nWhere lsof tells you which drives to try unmounting from the errors,\n\n\n\nHope this helps somewhat... even if it is somewhat after you ran into the problem.\n"

    "question" : "Does the Virtual PC XP-Mode (or any other virtualized mode) require safety measures, such as antivirus or a firewall?\n\nI'm just wondering if the XP-Mode would be a large security loophole, since it's so much more integrated into Windows 7. Actually I'm wondering the same for Portable Ubuntu, are their any safety measures I should undertake, so that I don't open a backdoor on my computer.\n",
    "acceptedAnswer" : "Yes. In essence, It is still just regular old virtualization, same as used in VMWare or VirualBox. Just because they share the same start menu items, does not make it any less (or more) secure.\n\nYou should always be taking the appropriate measures and cautions as with anything else. If you use antivirus, install it on both the host and guest OS.\n",
    "topAnswers" : [
      "From my understanding and experience with Virtual machines, they usually need seperate security measures. Seeing that they are \"bypassing\" antivirus software firewalls of the host PC / Server, you'd want Antivirus / SW-firewall on both the HOST and the vitual pc / server. \n\nA Physical Firewall placed before the gost would cover both the host and the virtual pc/server, because all network traffic passes through it.\n\nThis article covers mentions that exact issue\n\n\n  Woodgate noted that XP Mode isn't a security solution. Indeed, to protect their systems, users will need antivirus software running both on their Windows 7 desktop as well as a copy running inside their Windows XP virtual machine.\n\n\nAlso check out this blogpost concerning security of XP-mode in win7\n\n\n  The problem is that Microsoft are not providing management around the XP mode virtual machine (VM). This creates the potential for a security disaster. XP mode is an independent Windows instance, that shares the odd folder and device with the host Windows 7 installation. What it doesn't share is processes and memory. So it doesn't share security settings, security software, patches etc. It does not inherit any security from the host. When you use XP mode, you need to patch the copy of XP as well as the host Windows 7. You need to manage settings separately, configure two personal firewalls and install and manage two copies of anti-malware software.\n\n\nThis would mean having 2 seperate liscences for software, unless the specific software vendor has a liscencing scheme that covers virtualization. This may probably become more popular* now that Win7 is going to havebuitl in XP, since users will expect liscences for both operating systems.\n\n*: Assumption on my part, no facts to base this upon! :)\n",
      "I contacted Microsoft last week and asked them about the potential risks of using Windows XP Mode. They replied saying that due how it's implemented, the risk of malware breaking out of the VM is 'very unlikely'. They didn't go into further details, though.\n",
      "Just be sure to disable Integrated Devices -> Hard Drive sharing. Warning: Windows XP Mode not only can read the contents of your hard drive, it can also write and modify files in it with elevated security credentials. This is a very serious oversight by Microsoft. Most users assume that shared drives under Virtual Window XP mode follow normal behavior of shared folders, ie. if you did not explicitly share a drive, it will not be accessible, and if you do not have the right security credentials, access and modification is disabled. ALL OF THESE ARE BYPASSED BY WINDOWS XP MODE INTEGRATED DEVICES. That means all the files in the host machine can be accessed and modified by a program in the virtual machine. Be warned. Install security software as a precaution, or atleast disable Integrated Devices if you are lazy in keeping your virtual machine secure.\n",
      "The official answer from Microsoft is: yes it does need anti-virus software.\n\nThis is mentioned in the following video on Microsoft's web site:\nhttp://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/help/videos/using-windows-xp-mode\n\n\n  One more thing to note: anti-virus software is not included in Windows XP mode.\n  Even if your computer running Windows 7 already has anti-virus software, you should also install anti-virus software in Windows XP mode, to help defend your computer against viruses.\n\n\nAnd as other people have posted, this happily concurs with third-party reports on the subject.\n"

If you could get\n  the handle of the application that sent the key strokes, you could\n  track it back that way. With that handle you'd be able to get the\n  information you need quite easily.\n  \n  Other apps have tried determining hotkeys by going through their\n  Shortcuts since they can contain a Shortcut key, which is just another\n  term for hotkey. However most applications don't tend to set this\n  property so it might not return much. If you are interested in that\n  route, Delphi has access to IShellLink COM interface which you could\n  use to load a shortcut up from and get its hotkey:\n\n\n  \n  If you've got access to Safari Books Online, there is a good\n  section about working with shortcuts / shell links in the Borland\n  Delphi 6 Developer's Guide by Steve Teixeira and Xavier Pacheco.

And after the initial indexing is completed, the software continues to index files as needed. Users can start searching for files immediately after installing the program. After performing searches, results can also be returned in an Internet browser on the Google Desktop Home Page much like the results for Google Web searches.\n\nGoogle Desktop can index several different types of data, including email, web browsing history from Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox, office documents in the OpenDocument and Microsoft Office formats, instant messenger transcripts from AOL, Google, MSN, Skype, Tencent QQ, and several multimedia file types. Additional file types can be indexed through the use of plug-ins.[1] Google Desktop allows the user to control which types of data are indexed by the program.\n\nOne unfortunate aspect for users with large hard drives: Google Desktop only indexes 100,000 files per drive during the initial indexing period. If you have more than 100,000 files in a particular drive, Google Desktop won't index all of them during this initial period.

    "question" : "As much out of curiosity as anything else, a few weeks ago I installed Virtual PC on my old ThinkPad T41 and although I only set up a single W2K VM and have hardly touched it since, I've noticed that the machine is now much less responsive.\n\nI've eliminated the possibility that malware is causing the problem, it really does seem to stem from the time I installed VPC.\n\nShould Virtual PC cause this?  I notice there is a bug that makes it difficult to remove (not very confidence-inspiring...) so I need to look into that so I can uninstall and see it it makes any difference.  However, Windows being Windows I'm not 100% convinced that an uninstall may undo whatever VPC seems to have done.\n",
    "acceptedAnswer" : "Your CPU doesn't support hardware virtualization, so Virtual PC just sits on the application layer like any other program. Installing it shouldn't have caused any performance problems (beyond the usual contribution to Windows rot, I mean), and I certainly can't think of any reason why it would have an effect when it's not even running.\n\nCheck to see if the \"Virtual PC.exe\" process is present in the Processes tab of Task Manager when VPC isn't running. If it's not there, it's probably either coincidence or the result of some kind of installation error.\n",
    "topAnswers" : "VM's share all the hardware components of your system so when a vm is running there's two systems accessing your hardware instead of one. I personally didn't get into VMs until I had atleast a dual-core system and lots of RAM.  A better configuration would be to have two harddrives as well. One harddrive that's devoted to VMs and the other for the host operating system.\n\nW2k is pretty lightweight relative to these days but running it in a VM on a T41 will probably slow the T41 down considerably.\n"

      "I think Windows Firewall is sufficient.\n",
      "In case Windows Firewall is properly configured than answer is no. If you don't operate some network server (for example http) you have basically two options:\n\n1) Block all incomming connections, allow all outgoing connections. This is recommended setting for inexperienced users dont knowing all the aspects of computer security. You simply set it after installing operating system and can forget about it. Disadvantage is that you allow access to network for viruses, spam, trojans and so on running on your computer.\n\n\n\n2) Block all incomming connections, allow only those of outgoing connections for which there is rule created.\n\n\n\nThis is how list of rules looks like on my private computer:\n\n\n\nPotential disadvantage of second solution is that it really annoys to manually create new rule for every new application in system. For this reason I switched to Eset Smart Security. This is a software from slovak company containing antivirus + firewall + anti-spam protection solutions in one package. Now I have Windows Firewall disabled and using only Eset firewall (this is ensured automatically in ESS installer but you can check this in Control Panels). There is very cool thing named interactive mode. When there is new application in system trying to connect to network, Eset displays message window. You can allow or disallow network access for this particular running instance of application. If you know that this new application you will be using very often, you have option to store new setting as rule.

    "question" : "Recently I had my motherboard burn out on me.  Needing the machine for work, I purchased a different motherboard and installed that.  Generally a reinstall of windows is good at that point but I am not in a position to do that so I just decided I would live with it for now.  When I can log-in, everything works fine, what doesn't is getting to the log-in prompt to begin with.\n\nBasically when I first installed the new mobo, every time I rebooted the machine, I would not get the windows login prompt.  One of the monitors would receive a signal but the screen would be black.  Moving the mouse would not show the cursor and hitting the up arrow key and typing my password and hitting enter (which will normally log you in without mouse) wouldn't change anything.  I would then change the monitor configuration around (2 lcd's and a crt) and reboot and at least one of the monitors would work and display the login prompt.  I could then go into display properties and turn on the other monitors.  However if I rebooted again, I would get the black screen on one monitor again.  I would then have to change the configuration again to one not used before and I could re-do the manual setup at that point.  I think windows saves the configurations so I had to keep giving it new ones.\n\nNeedless to say I've been trying to not turn off my machine.  Early this week I actually got the prompt to come up without playing musical monitors.  Thinking everything was getting better, I found no harm in rebooting to install the latest windows updates.  Boy was I wrong.  Now no matter what I do I can't get a windows log-in prompt to display.  I've tried almost every conceivable combination.  The new mobo has onboard video so I set that in the bios (yea bios screen always displays fine, its not until windows boots that there is a problem) to be the primary video.  Still no luck.  I have two other graphics cards in the machine which I'm using.  Tried all kinds of configurations between those and on-board but still get this black screen of death.  I read somewhere that deleting the video drivers would reset the configurations.  I logged into safe mode (which works on one monitor), and uninstalled the display drivers.  Still no luck and when I booted back into safe mode, it wanted to install new hardware and the display adapters weren't there as expected.\n\nAnyone have any ideas?  A fresh install would be a pain and I might be getting my old board back from RMA soon so not sure I want to go through with that just yet.  Only thing I can think of is to continue to try other combinations like physically removing the graphics cards.  They are both EVGA 8600 cards and the windows boot screen does display fwiw.\n",
    "topAnswers" : [
      "The problem is almost certainly a conflict between what Windows EXPECTS, and what is ACTUALLY present, in terms of the display configuration. Unfortunately, as you have experienced, it is very tough to get a new configuration to 'stick' in these circumstances.\n\nI'd recommend the following:\n\n\nRemove all graphics cards.\nConnect one monitor to the onboard video.\nCheck that the onbaord video is enabled in the BIOS.\nBoot Windows.\n\n\nYou should now be able to use 640x480, at least. Install your display drivers for the cards you use, reboot. Makes sure everything still works. Now insert ONE video card and connect the monitor to that, and boot. If that works, add another monitor to that card, and so on and so forth, proceeding until everything works again.\n",
      "Have you tried the following:\n\n\nRemove the add-on graphics cards, and\nboot using on-board graphics card\nonly?\nLooks like you have 3 monitors, so\nunplug two of them and use only one.\nDo you get the login prompt now?\nIf either of the above two works (and you can login), try re-installing the chipset drivers for this new motherboard (from the manufacturer's website), and see if you still get these problems with additional monitors.\n\n",
      "Did the old motherboard have onboard video as well?  Were you using it, or were all the monitors pluged into the EVGA8600s (newegg's website implies that they have dual video ports).  If so,  try disabling the Onboard in BIOS, then pluging the monitors back into the EVGA8600s.  This may get back to what Windows expects to see, since you have not reloaded all the drivers for the new MOBO.\n"

    ],
    "acceptedAnswer" : "Unfortunately, no. And I believe this is by design.\n\nThe issue is that the Windows clipboard does not have to store the data. It is effectively a clearing house where any application can list the data that was just copied (or cut) and offer it up to any application (including itself) to be pasted. The clipboard contains a list of formats in which the data is available, and if the application chooses to do so, the data itself in some of those formats.\n\nThe application that processes a Paste operation then has the option to choose the data format that best suits it. Some applications (e.g. Notepad) will only accept one particular format (such as plain text) and simply do nothing if that format is not available. Others pick a preferred format by default but provide a UI for choosing among alternatives that can be understood by that application.\n\nIn principle a program could be written that monitors the clipboard for new content and flattens any non-text content to just plain text. There is an event available to notify such a monitor of new content on the clipboard. However, I suspect that implementing such a thing would break a fair number of programs, and possibly in surprising ways.\n\nThe simple workaround in stock XP is to use Notepad to flatten the data when needed, or to use one of the many tools that improve the clipboard by implementing a stack, providing a view of its content, and so forth.\n\nIf you want to try building a tool yourself, might benefit from this question over at SO, and its related questions....\n",

    "acceptedAnswer" : "There are two sides to this question. The first is why does this feature exist at all, and the second is why doesn't the GUI (or the command prompt) make it easier to see and manage the feature.\n\nIt exists because it's useful. Several other platforms support multiple data streams per file. On the Mac, they were called forks, for example. I'm reasonably sure that similar things existed in the mainframe world, but can't put my fingers on any explicit examples today.\n\nOn modern Windows, it is used to hold extra attributes for a file. You might notice that the Properties box available from Windows Explorer has a Summary tab that in Simple view (I'm on Windows XP, your mileage will differ on the other flavors) includes a bunch of useful fields like Title, Subject, Author, and so forth. That data is stored in an alternate stream, rather than creating some kind of side-car database to hold it all that would get separated from the file too easily.\n\nAn alternate stream is also used to hold the marker that says the file came from an untrusted network source that is applied by both Internet Explorer and Firefox on downloads.\n\nThe hard question is why there isn't a better user interface for noticing that the streams exist at all, and why it is possible to put executable content in them and worse, execute it later. If there is a bug and security risk here, this is it.\n\nEdit: \n\nInspired by a comment to another answer, here is one way to find out if your anti-virus and/or anti-malware protection is aware of alternate streams.\n\nGet a copy of the EICAR test file. It is 68 bytes of ASCII text that happens to also be a valid x86 executable. Although completely harmless, it has been agreed by the anti-virus industry to be detected as if it were a real virus. The originators thought that testing AV software with a real virus would be a little too much like testing the fire alarm by lighting the wastebasket on fire...\n\nThe EICAR file is:\n\n\n\nSave it with the extension .COM and it will execute (unless your AV is paying attention) and print a greeting.\n\nIt would be informative to save it in an alternate data stream and run a scan...\n",

Yes it is I have it running and in use daily on a server in a client that I support.\n\nThe main security issue comes when people and applications forget or don't realize that it is there.\n\nThere probably should be an option though to include the forks in the total file size or show them in windows explorer.\n",
      "Here's a good article on the potential security vulnerability posed by Alternate Data Streams.\n",
      "I'd imagine one of the main uses (perhaps even the intended use) would be to transparently allow addition of any kind of meta-data to a file. The reason the file size does not change is in this scenario you do not want the file to look or behave any differently lest the originating application relies on some aspect of the way the file looks.\n\nI could imagine interesting uses in IDEs for example, where sometimes multiple files are involved to form a single unit (code file / form file, etc), which could be attached to the original file in this way so that they cannot accidentally get separated.\n\nI also believe there is a command to find all such 'attachments' in a given directory tree, so they are not actually completely hidden. It also would surprise me if the better virus scanners are not aware of this and check these 'hidden' areas, but you could check that by purposely attaching an infected executable to a text file and seeing if it gets picked up.\n",

    "acceptedAnswer" : "TL;DR - If you have one of the below I/O controller hubs, leave the MSM installed to enable AHCI and native command queueing. Do so even if you have drives not in a RAID configuration.\n\nDetails: From the Matrix Storage Manager FAQ:\nDo I need Intel® Matrix Storage Manager if I don't want to use RAID?\n\n\n  The Intel® Matrix Storage Manager is\n  recommended for installation on\n  platforms with the below controller\n  hubs, even if you do not want to take\n  advantage of the benefits of RAID.\n  This is because it also provides\n  support for Advanced Host Controller\n  Interface (AHCI) on those platforms.\n  \n  Some of the benefits of AHCI include\n  increased performance and new usage\n  models, enabled by features such as\n  Native Command Queuing (NCQ), hot\n  plug, and Link Power Management (LPM).\n  \n  Intel® Matrix Storage Manager, when\n  used in conjunction with a hard drive\n  that supports NCQ and one of the below\n  chipsets, can increase storage\n  performance on random workloads.

      "If you have an Intel software RAID, I'm pretty sure that's the monitor/management program for it. If you uninstall it, you'll likely not be informed of any disk failures, and possibly you'll have to use the BIOS utility to rebuild after any failure (or, maybe, rebuild will not be possible at all)\n\nIntel's page about it: http://www.intel.com/support/chipsets/imsm/\n",
      "Unfortunately, the MSM ROM Bios has the tools to configure a RAID, but it actually does not manage it, except to perform automatic XORing, mirroring and striping for updating disks or reading from them (i.e. just to perform basic single sector remappings and a feow supplementary I/Os on other disk members).\nThe actual rebuild requires OS support to perform the actual rebuild by performing null read/writes to the sectors, so that the BIOS will compute the XORs and remap the sectors on the actual disks. When the reconstruction is finished, the RAID controler will maintain a basic growing counter of sectors that have been checked and rewritten on all disks. and when the last sector is reached, it will update the final sector on each disk of the array and will send a signal to a listening driver that the reconstruction is finished. The RAID controler itself does not expose a lot of things except the value of its current sectors counter that the OS still needs to read (to allow the BIOS to check and update the other disks).\n\nIf there's any error, the option ROM BIOS will suddenly shutdown the array and you'll your RAID volumes being dismounted, as if they were ejected abruptly (the BIOs will commit terminate its pending writes on member disks and will then stop these disks to low power mode, waiting for you to reboot to see what to do : you would notmally have to install a new spare disk and then reset the RAID array to recover mode, and the rebuild will then restart from sector zero... Very stupidly !).\n\nUnfortunately, the option ROM BIOS can be used to set the disks to recovery mode, but the volumes won't be available to the OS as long as the reconstruction of the initial vital sectors needed to recognize the volume partitions have not been rebuilt to allow the OS to remount the volume. So the next boot will still have the disks missing for some time, but you still need to reboot without these volumes. If your RAID volume contains files needed to boot Windows, this means that Windows won't be able to boot : you'll still need to boot from a Windows DVD of Flash key, just to go up to the failsafe mode, where the iastor*.sys drivers are loaded and able to work on the recovery process requested.\n\nWhy can't the ROM BIOS start making the recovery when you're still in the option BIOS screen ? It's a mystery, it should not require a lot of code in the ROM BIOS to perform this task safely, without being interrupted by concurrent accesses by the OS.\n\nAlso the MSM is poor in how you can partition your volumes on your array : only TWO volumes are supported at most (Volume0 for the start of the array, and ALL the rest for Volume1, using the same number of disks and with a limited choice of RAID options for Volume1 once you have chosen the RAID mode for Volume0).\n\nMSM on IRST is a toy, not serious to consider. If your PC has it, consider buying another better PCIexpress RAID controller.\n\nIn addition, IRST is installed on some motherboards in such as occupies all ports SATA AHCI ports 0-5, and a typical RAID 5 would normally occupy 5 ports, leaving only 1 port available to boot from something else (if you have activated the RAID BIOS, the system can no longer boot on other SATA ports managed by supplementary controlers!) Notably you should expect being able to boot your system on a SSD (installed on the 6th port, but how will you install it if you can't boot from a DVD ? You'll need to plug your SSD on the 6th port, the DVD will be on a 7th port but not available for booting and installing Windows or another OS on your SSD. So you'll need to install the OS from a USB key (make sure your standard BIOS ROM allows booting from a USB Flash disk on which you've copied the installer, and make sure you have this key available if ever you need to enter in recovery mode). The alternative is to use an external DVD reader plugged in an USB port).\n\nMSM IRST is preinstalled on motherboards in such a way that any RAID5 configuration is supposed to host the OS (and this is a false assumption, as a RAID5 is generally used to store a lot of data : your documents, and the backups of your OS and applications or documents or databases).\n\nRAID5 is unusable if your controler just has 4 to 6 ports on which it canb boot, it should have at least 8 ports (5 ports for your RAID5 volumes, plus 1 port for the spare drive, plus 1 SSD for the OS and your applications, plus 1 DVD reader), you should also have other ports for connecting a large enough backup (for this usage consider performing backups onto USB disks and once a backup completes and is verified, make a copy to another USB volume, but don't perform continuous backups to a RAID-mirrored pair of disks, but if you do, it should be usaing another controler. But the problem is that the other RAID controler will not be able to mount its own ROM Bios...).\n\nReally, better solutioàns for RAID storages shoulf use better softwares not stored in ROM but managed in a bootable (and recoverable) UEFI partition with all tools needed to recover disks safely and then partition the rest of the RAID volume as you want; this UEFI Bios should also be able to controle everything including being able to check the contents of the volumes for various OSes using them in various filesystem formats.\n\nIdeally a RAID5 will better live within a NAS, with almost no BIOS but a Linux kernel stored in internal Flash, and with a Telnet CLI access to control it. This kernel should then be able to export share content in PXE bootable mode (for booting any kind of OS) or make it available on network with iSCSI protocol or other sharing filesystems (NFS, CMB/LanMan/NetBios, UPnP media players, FTP, ...).\n\nDo you really want RAID5 in Windows ? No. use a NAS (available to your Windows PC via a fast Gigabit Ethernet link, or a faster Fiber channel, or at least USB3).\n"

    "question" : "I've got a bit of a strange problem, or at least one that I didn't anticipate. I used to have two partitions on my computer, C and D, both NTFS. Using a partition manager, I deleted the D partition and resized C to take up the whole space.\n\nHowever, now when I try and save a file from any program (anything, including things like Paint and WordPad) the program crashes. No error messages, no nothing, it just exits silently. This only occurs when saving a new file (ie. to a new filename), re-saving existing files works fine.\n\nI've done loads of things with partitions over the years and never had this problem. Any idea what I should do? I've tried reinstating the D partition (ie. just creating another partition called D), but that hasn't helped. I can't see any important references to D:\\ in the registry. Any other ideas?\n\nI'm using Windows XP on a laptop if that matters.\n\nUpdates:\n\n\nThe event logs don't show anything related to this at all (as far as I can seE)\nProcMon shows what looks like the standard accesses to the registry and so on. It doesn't seem to be trying to access any paths that don't exist. The last thing it does is close the Common Controls dialog box - although I (as the user) never see that dialog box appear.\nI've done what you suggested with ProcMon. The ProcessExit entry had a return code of SUCCESS, as did all the ThreadExit entries. There were various CreateFile entries, all of which also returned SUCCESS. Weird. I should point out, I don't know if I made it clear earlier, that the program exits as soon as I click on the Save toolbar button or menu item, ie. before the save dialog box is shown and I choose a file.\nI've tried running System File Checker (SFC /SCANNOW), but it wants a Windows XP Professional CD, and the only Windows CD I have is a different version. I'll try and find an XP Professional CD soon and try that again.\nI'm running chkdisk now\n\n",

      "Note:\n\n\nAfter resizing the NTFS, have checked the structure of the file system - chkdsk?\n\n\nHave you viewed the Event Viewer - maintains logs about program, security, and system events on your computer.

To access see here.\n\nYou can also use Procmon - which allows you to view and monitor processes running on a system. One useful ability: monitoring of process and thread startup and exit, including exit status codes.\n\nWorse case scenario, use a Linux Live CD, mount the NTFS file system, and copy your files over to some external medium. Then format if possible with a fresh installation of Windows.\n\nEdit:\n\nRegarding testing the execution of mspaint: \n\n\nfind the PID\nUsing Procmon, filter according to mspaint's PID accordingly\nWhile mspaint is executing, save a file (via mspaint) to observe CreateFile operation, if possible, double click to see if the operation was successful\nIf crash occurs, using Procmon see Process Exit, double click to view Exit Status?\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nAs you are probably aware, Windows XP has the ability to protect itself from system instability caused by 3rd party software overwriting important system files (System File Checker). Please try and find the suitable disk to repair accordingly.\n",

    "question" : "It seems that almost every time I re-install windows on my PC I end up forgetting to back up something. Now I consider myself an experienced pc-user, and I've done this tons of times, but it never ceases to amaze me how often I forget to backup something (sometimes important, sometimes trivial). I take it that it's usually because from the time i decide to re-install to when i start is pretty short, which really isn't a good thing\n\nWhat I'm looking for is to build a checklist of common backup-todos before making a full re-install so that this hopefully won't happen again.\n\nUpdate:\nTo clarify a little, I'm interested in a good BASE-checklist I can use as a start. Which cover as many important components as possible. ie: Browser settings, Email, passwords, Contacts etc..\n\nThere will always be user-specific customization (apps, skins, plugin settings etc) which cannot be covered by this type of checklist, and that's ok.\n",

It does not affect the way your OS or programs write to the disk.\n\nSo, if some program write()s a lot of data without flush()ing, and you disconnect that external hard drive, some data may be not fully written at that moment. But it has nothing to do with TrueCrypt.\n\nIf windows, or the program you are using doesn't treat removable media in some special way, then there is no difference how you mount that drive (beyond those pesky folders).\n",
    "topAnswers" : "According to TrueCrypt FAQ if you use your USB drive safely as you would for any other data storage, things will work fine.\n\n\n  Can I unplug or turn off a hot-plug device (for example, a USB flash drive or USB hard drive) when there is a mounted TrueCrypt volume on it?\n  \n  Before you unplug or turn off the device, you should always dismount the TrueCrypt volume in TrueCrypt first, and then perform the 'Eject' operation if available (right-click the device in the 'Computer' or 'My Computer' list), or use the 'Safely Remove Hardware' function (built in Windows, accessible via the taskbar notification area). Otherwise, data loss may occur. \n\n\n\n\nBased on your question,\nI wonder if the BootIt tool might be usable for you.\nHere is a reference discussing it with TrueCrypt.\n"

    "question" : "Is it possible to install/use/update iTunes without also having to install the eternal hellspawn known as Apple Quicktime? \n\nWhen you install Apple Quicktime, it installs its QTTask.exe executable to run automatically on startup (what the hell does that do anyway?). Not only that, but it keeps coming back if you remove it from the registry. It also immorally takes over media file playing on web browsers without asking (Screw you Apple!). \n\nOne solution I'm aware of is the heaven-sent \"QuickTime Alternative\", aka QTA. Is there a definitive catch-all tutorial for it?\n\nBONUS: Even though iTunes is able to play along with QTA, every time you update to a new version of iTunes, you have re-uninstall Apple Quicktime, and then re-install QTA. Is there a workaround for this inconvenience?\n",

      "If you don’t purchase music via iTunes and only use it to import your CDs and such into your iPod, another option is to forego iTunes altogether. Redchair makes Anapod Explorer which is pretty good. Another one that works without installing anything on your system—and is free!—is vPod (which I don’t believe does photos or videos though).\n",
      "I can't confirm this because I do have QT installed with iTunes but I would assume there is a degree of dependency between the two, namely it's quite possible that iTunes would also use some of the QT APIs for video\n\nAs stated above I could be wrong but it's something to investigate before uninstalling QT\n"
